{"Row Number": 353, "Calculator Name": "HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk", "Calculator ID": "25", "Category": "risk", "Note ID": "10", "Patient Note": "A 72-year-old man finds himself back at the primary care clinic for his routine visit. His well-documented history of uncontrolled hypertension is a notable element in his case file. However, there is no suggestion of a previous stroke episode. He admits to patronizing alcohol, averaging 9 drinks per week. Also noteworthy in his medical history are his liver and renal conditions. On the one hand, he has had numerous hospital admissions over the years with repeated indications of hepatic impairment due to ALD. His renal function has also been a concern, as demonstrated by an elevated creatinine and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Contrarily, when it comes to bleeding risk, he has never been prescribed any medication known to accelerate bleeding. His coagulation profiles are quite stable, demonstrated by a consistently normal international normalized ratio (INR). These medical intricacies necessitate a comprehensive, focused approach to his healthcare management.", "Question": "What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?", "LLM Answer": "3", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "5", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current HAS-BLED score is 0.\r\nThe patient is 72.0 years old. Because the patient's age is greater than 65 years, we increment the score by 1, making the current score 0 + 1 = 1.\r\nThe patient has 9 drinks a week. Because the patient has at least 8 alcoholic drinks a week, we increment the score by 1, making the current score 1 + 1 = 2.\r\nThe issue, hypertension, is reported to be present for the patient note and so we increase the score by 1, making the current score 2 + 1 = 3.\r\nThe issue, liver disease, is reported to be present for the patient note and so we increase the score by 1, making the current score 3 + 1 = 4.\r\nThe issue, renal disease, is reported to be present for the patient note and so we increase the score by 1, making the current score 4 + 1 = 5.\r\nThe issue, stroke history, is reported to be absent for the patient and so we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 5.\r\nThe issue, prior bleeding, is missing from the patient note and so we assume it to be absent and so we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 5.\r\nThe issue, labile inr, is reported to be absent for the patient and so we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 5.\r\nThe issue, medications for bleeding, is reported to be absent for the patient and so we do not change the score, keeping the current score at 5.\r\nHence, the patient's HAS-BLED score is 5.", "Result": "Incorrect"}
