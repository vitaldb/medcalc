His medical history revealed having throat infection one month before admission. Complete blood count was within normal range for his age, as were his serum electrolytes. Blood examinations revealed an elevation of C-reactive protein and revealed both normal white blood cell and platelet counts. Serum IgA, C3 and C4 levels were all within normal limits and a urine examination also showed normal findings. Physical examination revealed mild proteinuria, hypertension and moderate anasarca (periorbital edema, ascites, and lower-extremity pitting edema). No medication and renal biopsy were performed because of the silent findings. However, two weeks later, after the admission for HSP, he complained of polydipsia and polyuria complaints and a physical examination revealed a 10-kg decrease in his baseline weight. There was no parental history of diabetes.

Skin turgor and tonus were also diminished. There were petechial rashes on his abdomen and lower extremities that progressed to nonblanchable macules (Figure ). He also had a fruity breath smell, dry mucous membranes, and tachypnea. Other examinations were normal. Laboratory studies yielded the following values (normal ranges were given in brackets): white blood cell count; 14.200/mm3 (6000\u201317500) with a normal differential formula; blood urea nitrogen, 9.34 mg/dL (5.7\u201320.1); serum creatinine, 0.6 mg/dL (0.1\u20130.9); albumin, 4.2 g/dL (3.5-5); sodium, 127 mmol/L (139\u2013146); potassium, 4.51 mmol/ L (3.5\u20136.0); phosphorus, 2.8 mg/dL (4.9\u20137.9); and glucose, 27.83 mmol/L (3.3\u20135.0). Arterial blood gas values showed a pH of 7.10 (7.35\u20137.45); and bicarbonate: 8.4 mmol/L (21\u201328). Urine and serum ketones were positive. Urinalysis showed glycosuria. HbA1c was 11.7% (4.2-6.4). C-peptid level was 0.7 ng/mL (1.1-3.2). Insulin level was 4.28 \u03bcIU/mL (1.9-23).

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 27.83 mmol. To convert 27.83 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 27.83 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.02783 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.02783 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 5.01385 g glucose. To convert 5.01385 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 5.01385 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 5013.85 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 5013.85 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 501.385 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 27.83 mmol glucose/L converts to 501.385 mg glucose/dL. \nPlugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 127.0 + (9.34 / 2.8) + (9.34 / 18) = 285.19044 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 285.19044 mmol/L.

Three years ago, the stent had been removed, and he had begun to take oral prednisone 30 mg/day. The bile duct stenosis and pancreatic mass had been successfully eliminated, so the prednisone treatment had been discontinued 3 months prior to presentation. In the past month, he had experienced rapid progression of renal function. His medical history also included hypertension and diabetes. With the exception of bilateral lower limb edema, the findings from the physical examination conducted at the time of presentation were unremarkable.\nLaboratory tests showed that his white blood cell count was 5.06 \u00d7 109/L; hemoglobin, 87 g/L; platelet count, 126 \u00d7 109/L; CRP, 30.23 mg/L; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 80 mm/H; serum nitrogen, 32.79 mmol/L; serum creatinine, 555.8 \u03bcmol/L; and serum albumin, 32.7 g/L.

Because the patient's age is between 55 and 64, 3 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 3 = 3.\nThe patient note does not report any history on immunocompromise and so we assume this to be false. Hence, 0 points are added to the total, keeping the total at 3 points.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 55.0%.\nBecause the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 364. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 350 and 500, we add 3 points to the total, making the current total 3 + 3 = 6.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is between 36 and 38.5 degrees celsius, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 6.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 135.0 mm Hg + 2/3 * 75.0 mm Hg = 95.0 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 95.0 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 6.\nThe patient's heart rate is 95.0 beats per minute.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 6.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 19.0 breaths per minute.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 6.\nThe patient's pH is 7.32.\nBecause the patient's pH is between 7.25 and 7.32, 2 points are added to the score, making the current total 6 + 2 = 8.\nThe concentration of sodium is 138.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mEq. To convert from 138.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 138.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 138.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 138.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 138.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 8.\nThe concentration of potassium is 4.5 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.5 mEq. To convert from 4.5 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.5 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.5 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.5 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.5 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.5 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 8.\nThe concentration of creatinine is 3.8 mg/dL. The patient is determined to have an acute renal failure.\nThe patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.\nBecause the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level above 3.5, 8 points are added to the score, making the current total 8 + 8 = 16.\nThe patient has a hematocrit of 43.0%.\nBecause the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 16.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 12000.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 12000.0 count/\u00b5L of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L which will give 12000.0 white blood cell count count/\u00b5L * 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L = 12000000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 16.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 14. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 14 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 14 = 1. Hence, we add 1 to the total making the current total 1 + 16 = 17.\nHence, the patient's APACHE II score is 17.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Physical examination revealed mild tenderness and swelling in the lower abdomen; the bowel sounds were enhanced. No purpura was found, which is characteristic of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura.\nA blood test performed on admission revealed mild anemia (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL), hypoalbuminemia (2.6 g/dL), mildly elevated C-reactive protein (3.24 mg/dL), and elevated serum creatinine (5.24 mg/dL) levels. The stool culture test results were negative. Tuberculosis and anisakiasis were ruled out by interferon-gamma releasing assays and anisakis antibody tests, respectively.\nAbdominal radiography in the standing position revealed dilatation of the small intestine and air-fluid levels in the intestine (shown in Fig. ); plain computed tomography (CT) showed a stenotic site with wall thickening and dilatation of the small intestine on the oral side from the stenosis (shown in Fig. ). After admission, we inserted an ileus tube to ameliorate the elevated intraluminal pressure. Contrast medium from the tube showed a stricture at the end of the ileum (shown in Fig. ). We conducted TUS using Sonazoid TM and elastography techniques, which demonstrated a thickened wall and unclear stratification of the intestinal wall in the lower right abdomen (shown in Fig. ). The length of stricture was 70 mm, and the minimum lumen diameter was 5 mm. The small intestine on the oral side of the lesion was markedly dilated. Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed sufficient mucosal blood flow in the stenotic lesion (Fig. ). Ultrasound elastography revealed lower elasticity of the intestinal lesion site than the elasticity of other intact parts of the small intestine that did not show wall thickening or stenosis (strain ratio [local deformation ratio under slight pressure]: 2.52) (Fig. ). Based on these findings, the patient was clinically diagnosed with IE. Conservative therapies including fasting and total parenteral nutrition were initiated after the diagnosis; however, the patient's condition did not improve.\nSurgery was performed, and the stenotic lesion was surgically resected.

We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 70.0 = 70.0.\nBecause the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 70.0 - 10 = 60.0.\nWhether patient is a nursing home resident is not reported. Hence, we assume this to be false and so not add any points to the current total keeping it at 60.0.\nNeoplastic disease is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 60.0.\nLiver disease history is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 60.0.\nCHF History is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 60.0 + 10 = 70.0.\nCerebrovascular disease history is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 70.0 + 10 = 80.0.\nRenal Disease History is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 80.0.\nAltered Mental Status is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 80.0.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 80.0 + 10 = 90.0.\nThe patient's pulse is 80.0 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 90.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 36.8 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 90.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.36. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 90.0.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 19.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 90.0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 90.0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 26.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 90.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 135.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mEq. To convert from 135.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 135.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 135.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 135.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 135.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 90.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 4.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 4.8 mmol. To convert 4.8 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 4.8 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.005 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.005 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 0.901 g glucose. To convert 0.901 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.901 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 901.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 901.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 90.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 4.8 mmol glucose/L converts to 90.1 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 90.0.\nThe patient's hematocrit is 44.0 %. The patient's hematocrit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 90.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 77.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 90.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 90.0.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

He complained of abdominal pain and inability to move his legs beginning five hours prior to arrival. He awakened from a nap that afternoon and experienced numbness in both legs, which progressed to paralysis. At baseline, he was ambulatory without any history of weakness and was last ambulatory hours prior. He endorsed occasional pain in his legs when walking at baseline.\nHe also complained of abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting for two days. He had a history of alcohol use and reported dark-colored emesis and last bowel movement three days prior. On review of symptoms the patient denied any history of headache, dizziness, chest pain, back pain, trauma, fevers, or extremity weakness. He walked longer than a mile the day prior. History from the patient\u2019s wife revealed that he had an episode of altered level of consciousness while on the couch and that finding combined with his abdominal pain and paralysis prompted her to call 911. The patient\u2019s past medical history was significant for hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, and myocardial infarction 10 years prior. His past surgical history included \u201cabdominal stents\u201d and a left carotid stent. His social history was significant for a 25-pack/year history of smoking and daily alcohol.

His weight was 72.5kg and he appeared older than his stated age. He was alert, cooperative and in moderate distress, primarily complaining of pain and cramping in his lower extremities and repeatedly asking staff to straighten out his legs although they were already lying straight and motionless on the gurney. His head exam was unremarkable with the exception of a dry oropharynx. Cervical spine, cardiac, and lung exams were unremarkable. His abdomen was firm and diffusely tender to palpation with generalized rebound and guarding. An irreducible left inguinal hernia was present. He had vomiting, and placement of a nasogastric tube revealed 1.5 liters of coffee-ground emesis. Lower extremities were thin, cool, and without any palpable or Dopplerable pulses in bilateral femoral, popliteal or pedal distribution. There was trace non-reproducible sensation to the mottled lower extremities, and no sensation distal to the ankles. Motor exam was significant for lower extremity paralysis.\nLaboratory data consisted of sodium 121mEq/L (135\u2013145), potassium 6.8mEq/L (3.3\u20134.8), chloride 89mEq/L (101\u2013111), HCO3- 18mEq/L (25\u201334), BUN 31mg/dL (8\u201326), creatinine 1.5mg/dL (0.5\u20131.3), and blood glucose 367mg/dL (70\u2013115).

Bedside ultrasound to evaluate the abdominal aorta was limited. Vascular surgery was consulted prior to CT for concern of a vascular catastrophe. Cardiology was consulted for the patient\u2019s ECG findings consistent with myocardial infarction. The patient went for a non-contrast head CT that was unremarkable and a CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, which was significant for the abdominal aorta with no contrast opacification 2.2cm superior to the bifurcation (), high-grade stenosis of the right common iliac artery, complete occlusion of the left common iliac artery, stents in the celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery (SMA), evidence of occlusion of the proximal SMA and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), hepatic, splenic, bilateral renal infarctions, left inguinal hernia, bowel obstruction, pneumatosis intestinalis with evidence of ischemic bowel, and aspiration in the right lower lung. General surgery was consulted.\nThe cardiology service stated that the patient was not a candidate for cardiac catheterization and to start anticoagulation and low-dose aspirin if there was no contraindication or planned surgery. They also recommended thrombolytics for the diffuse thrombotic disease. The patient did have an echocardiography study that revealed an ejection fraction of 35% and multiple regional wall motion abnormalities. General surgery recommended comfort measures as he was not a surgical candidate. Vascular surgery commented that bypass would be futile and if patient survived, would be a candidate for extra-anatomical axillo-bifemoral bypass in the future.

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 15.0 mmol. To convert 15.0 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 15.0 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.015 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.015 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 2.702 g glucose. To convert 2.702 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.702 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 2702.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2702.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 270.2 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 15.0 mmol glucose/L converts to 270.2 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is greater than 250 mg/dL, and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 150.0 + 10 = 160.0.\nThe patient's hematocrit is 35.0 %. The patient's hematocrit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 160.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 67.0 mm Hg.

Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).\nAlong with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.\nThe findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.\nOn EGD, the patient\u2019s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient\u2019s lab derangements (Fig. ).\nThe decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\nThe patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.\nThe patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient\u2019s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning).

An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed before the surgery showed sinus tachycardia, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a preserved global left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction; 69%). The preoperative brain CT sacn showed a marked shrinkage of the left cerebral hemisphere and an increase in ventricular size (). The general anesthesia was induced with 125 mg thiopental sodium and 50 mg rocuronium, without any premedication. The vital signs were monitored using noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), ECG and a pulse oximeter. The tracheostomy tube was changed for a 7.5 mm cuffed tracheostomy tube. Following the induction of anesthesia, the right dorsalis pedis artery was cannulated with a 22 gauge catheter, and the right femoral vein was cannulated with an 18 gauge catheter.

While tapering the stress dose hydrocortisone, the patient developed transient hypotension, fever, and transaminitis episodes. Per discussion with the infectious disease team and primary oncologist, the thought was that the clinical presentation was likely related to immunotherapy.\nDespite the acute renal failure resolution, the patient remained with a severe hyperchloremic non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, along with persistent hypokalemia (the nadir of 2.4 mEq/L) indicating a distal (type-I) RTA.\nAlthough possible, antimicrobial-induced RTA was unlikely due to the resolution of the renal failure and that none of the agents are known culprits to manifest acid/base disturbances []. Giving rise to a suspected immunotherapy-induced RTA, the patient was started on prednisone one mg/kg and transitioned to sodium bicarbonate tablets. Repeat blood work revealed an appropriate response with downtrending liver enzymes and increased serum sodium bicarbonate, indicating a resolving RTA.\nFurther workup revealed a negative autoimmune panel (anti-Ro (SS-A), anti-La (SS-B), ANA). SPEP, UPEP, free light chains, hepatitis serology, and thyroid function tests were unremarkable. Alkaline urine, a positive urinary anion gap, a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis with low serum bicarbonate, and persistent hypokalemia suggested a distal-type-1 RTA.\nThe patient followed up with nephrology and oncology as an outpatient.

Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3\u2212 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10\u201350 pg/ml) level.\nUrinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.\nThe calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3\u2212 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient\u2019s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).\nThe patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10). Sequential liver biopsy demonstrated the presence of a periportal cellular infiltrate (Fig. ), compatible with PBC though biochemical liver function was normal. The combination of these findings led to the patient\u2019s diagnosis of osteomalacia caused by TIN with Fanconi syndrome in asymptomatic PBC.\nThe patient was started on therapy with calcitriol (1 \u03bcg/day), neutral potassium phosphate and sodium bicarbonate (6 g/day). She was subsequently administered middle-dose corticosteroid (20 mg/day of predonisolone) and ursodeoxycholic acid (300 mg/day).

This test showed an intensive hypermetabolic mass at the pancreatic head and neck portion with multiple common hepatic, portocaval, aortocaval, hepatoduodenal, para-aortic, left common iliac, mediastinum, right lower paratracheal, and right interlobar lymph node metastases in addition to numerous tiny bilateral lung and both pleural metastases.\nAccording to these clinical and radiologic findings, PTTM secondary to advanced pancreatic cancer was suggested as the final diagnosis. The clinical stage was TxN2M1, stage IV according to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system [].

Patient\u2019s social history was negative for smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use. Initial vital signs were Blood Pressure 109/68, Pulse 101, Repiratory Rate 16, Temperature 98.1, and O2 saturation of 100% on room air. On exam, the patient was noted to have edema and tenderness to palpation of his entire right neck, with erythema tracking from the superior border of his right clavicle to the angle of the jaw on the right. No induration, crepitus or bullae were noted on the skin. Oral examination was remarkable for edema and erythema of the right anterior tonsil, without exudates or fluctuance, with mild deviation of the uvula to left. The laboratory values were significant for elevated leukocyte count of 29,000 with 89.9 % neutrophils and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine of 37 and 2.32, respectively. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck without contrast showed extensive edema in the oropharynx/hypopharynx, with edema and air within the retropharyngeal and danger space, as well as debris within the piriform sinus ( and ). Given the clinical exam, CT findings highly suspicious for \u201ca gas-forming organism or necrotizing fasciitis,\u201d and his laboratory results, blood cultures were drawn and intravenous clindamycin, vancomycin and ceftriaxone were empirically started. Otolaryngology was emergently consulted and the decision was made to immediately take the patient to the operating room for incision, drainage and washout.\nFollowing nasotracheal intubation in the operating room (OR), the right neck was explored laterally into the retropharyngeal space. Purulent drainage was found to track via an overlying necrotic fascial plane into the parapharyngeal spaces as well as inferiorly into the superior mediastinum. Intraoperative gram stain showed gram positive cocci in both chains and clusters, gram negative rods and gram positive rods. The antibiotic regimen was changed to piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole (with discontinuation of clindamycin and ceftriaxone). Final wound culture grew Streptococcus anginosus and coagulase negative staphylococcus. The patient remained intubated postoperatively, and a repeat CT was performed on postoperative day 4 due to persistent leukocytosis. A residual phlegmon in the bilateral piriform sinuses was discovered, and the patient was then taken back to the OR for repeat right neck exploration, direct laryngoscopy, and bilateral incision and drainage of the peritonsillar space. Intra-operatively, cardiothoracic surgery was consulted to perform an open lateral thoracotomy to drain a posterior mediastinal phlegmon.\nDespite repeat drainage, the patient began to decompensate, requiring multiple vasopressors to maintain adequate perfusion, and he suffered from persistent fevers, acute renal failure and transaminitis (aspartate aminotransferase 4202, alanine aminotransferase 1922). His leukocytosis continued to rise, peaking at 51,600. On postoperative day 7, the patient suffered a cardiac arrest requiring one round of chest compressions and epinephrine before return of spontaneous circulation. On postoperative day 9, his multisystem organ failure began to improve and the patient was slowly weaned off vasopressors, with successful extubation on postoperative day 12. He was discharged to a rehabilitation institution on postoperative day 21 with a peripherally inserted central catheter line to continue vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole for a total of four weeks.

Due to severe hypoxia, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). On hospital day 2, she underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation for worsening tachypnea and respiratory distress. The patient was started on intravenous steroids (methylprednisolone 40 mg every eight hours), received a dose of tocilizumab 400 mg, and completed a five-day course of hydroxychloroquine (800 mg/day for one day, then 400 mg/day for four days) and azithromycin (500 mg/day for one day, then 250 mg/day for four days).\nOn hospital day 3, her renal function worsened, and her creatinine peaked at 2.4 mg/dL, likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis. However, she remained with good urine output and no significant metabolic acidosis. Her creatinine gradually improved on the subsequent days, returning to the baseline renal function.

To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 67.0 = 37.22222 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.\nThe patient's heart rate is 106.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 10900.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 10900.0 count/\u00b5L of white blood cell to mm^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1.0 \u00b5L/mm^3 which will give 10900.0 white blood cell count/\u00b5L * 1.0 \u00b5L/mm^3 = 10900.0 white blood cell count/mm^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per mm^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 1.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 34.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.

CT findings revealed thickening of the arterial wall and an aneurysm of the left common iliac artery at the site of the stent (). On the basis of these findings, he was diagnosed with an infected aneurysm due to bare stent infection and underwent surgical treatment.\nThe terminal abdominal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries were removed because the infection had extended to the aortic bifurcation ().

In addition, she also intermittently took medications for amenorrhea and osteoporosis.\nOn admission, her vital signs were: blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, pulse rate of 60 beats/min, respiration rate of 20 breaths/min, and body temperature of 36.5\u2103. She was alert, but looked chronically ill and cachexic. Her body weight was 30 kg and body mass index was 11.71 kg/m2. She had a severely dehydrated tongue, but her chest and abdomen physical examination showed no abnormalities. Her laboratory examinations were as follows; white blood cell 8,940/mm3, hemoglobin 15.8 g/dL, hematocrit 43.8%, platelet 70,000/mm3, random blood glucose 132 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen/creatinine 35.9/0.44 mg/dL, total protein/albumin 5.6/3.6 g/dL, aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase 471/374 IU/L, total bilirubin 1.90 mg/dL, Na/K 127/2.6 mEq/L, Ca/P/Mg 8.5/5.3/1.6 mg/dL, total cholesterol 116 mg/dL, triglyceride 38 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 74 mg/dL, T3 0.43 ng/mL (0.78-1.82 ng/mL), free T4 0.94 ng/mL (0.85-1.86 ng/mL), thyroid stimulating hormone 1.71 mIU/L (0.17-4.05 mIU/L), adrenocoticotropic hormone 11.44 pg/mL (6.00-56.70 pg/mL), cortisol 17.40 ug/dL (9.41-26.06 ug/dL), and aldosterone 31.66 pg/mL (40-102 pg/mL). Initial cardiac biomarkers were elevated as follows; creatine kinase-MB 154.30 ng/mL (0-5 ng/mL), troponin-I 2.580 ng/mL (0-0.78 ng/mL) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide 8,963 pg/mL (0-155 pg/mL). Her chest X-ray and abdomen computed tomography showed no significant lesions associated with epigastic pain. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm (60 beats/min), prolonged corrected QT interval (543 ms), pathologic Q waves in II, III, aVF and V1-V3, inverted T waves in II, III and aVF and poor R progression in precordial leads (). Echocardiogram revealed large akinetic areas around the apical, inferior, anterior and lateral sides with hypercontraction of the basal segments, linear echogenic mural thrombus, pericardial effusion, and a reduction of ejection fraction to 36% (). Therefore, we strongly suspected that she was SICMP because of her characteristic echocardiograhic findings.\nOnly standard medical treatment was given to the patient since she and her guardian refused to receive a coronary angiogram. Therefore, we started the treatment with low molecular weight heparin, and nutrition support with immediate multi-systemic interventions. Psychiatric consultation was also accompanied by medical therapy. After three days, we stopped anticoagulation therapy due to aggravated thrombocytopenia and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Overall, her daily oral intake increased together with her body weight, 33 kg compared to 30 kg in the beginning. Electrolyte imbalance, liver dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia were also normalized. Two weeks later, the next follow-up echocardiogram indicated a significant improvement of the LV ejection fraction (42%) and wall motion abnormalities. On the other hand, apical mural thrombosis still remained and pericardial effusion increased (). On the next follow-up electrocardiogram, the corrected QT interval decreased to 453 ms. Furthermore, pathologic Q waves, inverted T waves and poor R progression observed in the initial ECG disappeared (). However, she and her guardian strongly insisted on discharging from the hospital against the clinician's recommendation. Although appointments with cardiology and psychiatry departments were arranged with continuing mental support and follow-up echocardiogram, she never came back to the hospital after her discharge.", "Question": "What is the patient's LDL cholestrol concentration?

The patient has a medical history pertinent to BPH, and his family history was relevant for a father with colon cancer.\nSix months earlier, his primary care physician (PCP) evaluated him for worsening urinary symptoms and subsequently referred him to a urologist. Upon further evaluation, his prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was normal at 3 ng/mL, and his digital rectal examination was normal, for which a cystoscopy with prostate GreenLight\u2122 (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) enucleation was performed for BPH diagnosis. Five months later and one month before this admission, he discerned progressive worsening of double vision. His PCP examined and referred him to an ophthalmologist, who diagnosed him with third cranial (oculomotor) and sixth cranial (abducens) nerve palsy, which was subsequently confirmed by a neurologist.\nSubsequently, the patient was admitted to the other hospital, and upon admission, he was found to have an acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperkalemia. Laboratory studies showed white blood cells of 27 x 10^3/\u00b5L, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, and platelet count of 201 K/\u00b5L. His chemistry was pertinent for sodium of 134 mmol/L, potassium of 6.5 mmol/L, chloride of 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate level of 10 mmol/L, a glucose of 159 mg/dL, creatinine of 13 mg/dL, uric acid of 19.6 \u00b5mol/L, chromogranin A of 656 \u00b5g/L, and PSA of 22.67 ng/mL. He received hemodialysis and underwent bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy, after which his AKI resolved. An abdominal CT scan showed findings consistent with diffuse metastatic disease to the lungs, liver, and peritoneum, and brain MRI showed brain lesions. Therefore, he was, subsequently, transferred to our hospital for further care.\nUpon evaluation in our hospital, imaging showed findings consistent with earlier recognized lesions at the other hospital (Figures -). The patient was, therefore, seen by a multidisciplinary team of a neurosurgeon, an ophthalmologist, a medical oncologist, and a radiation oncologist. Biopsies of a perirectal mass showed a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor. The oncologist who saw him diagnosed him with metastatic SCC of the lung; therefore, he was started on one cycle of carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy during his hospitalization, which he tolerated well and was discharged home.\nA senior oncologist saw the patient, reviewed all his radiographic images, and questioned the initial diagnosis of lung SCC based on the patient\u2019s clinical presentation of urinary obstruction, hydronephrosis, and AKI. Hence, the original tumor location speculated to be consistent with a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor/SCC originating from the urinary tract. The senior oncologist, therefore, advised cystoscopy for prostate biopsy, which was declined by consulting urologist because the \u201cprostate exam was normal.\u201d Consequently, the senior oncologist sent the patient to a second urologist who performed cystoscopy and informed the patient that everything was normal. The senior oncologist had a thorough discussion to explain the necessity of a meticulous endoscopic urethral examination and prostate biopsy. Subsequently, the patient took the senior oncologist\u2019s advice, went back to the urologist, and underwent a repeat diagnostic cystoscopy. This time, biopsies of the urethra were taken and confirmed a high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. \n \nThe tissue specimen from this case was compared to the patient\u2019s previous perirectal mass biopsy and was found to have similar features. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains were negative for CK7, CK20, PSA, and prostate-specific acid phosphatase. Scattered individual cells were positive for nuclear NKX 3.1 and cytoplasmic CK5. Moreover, there was diffuse variable positivity for nuclear p63 with greater than 80% of nuclei were positive for p53 and diffuse strong positivity for CD56, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and synaptophysin (Figure ).\nBased on the clinical history of disease distribution, the pathologist considered the neoplasm to be likely of either prostate or urinary bladder origin. Subsequently, the senior oncologist reviewed the urethral biopsy, remained suspecting the primary site of cancer to be originating from the prostate. Therefore, he advised for prostate biopsy. Finally, the patient underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, which confirmed that all 12 cores were positive for prostate SCC (Figure ). The pathology findings confirmed the senior oncologist\u2019s initial surmise that the metastatic cancer origin was from the genitourinary tract, likely involving prostate extending into the urethra.", "Question": "What is the patient's Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)?

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 140.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 140.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 140.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 140.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 140.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 140.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 92.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 92.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 92.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 92.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 92.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 92.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 37.8 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 37.8 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 37.8 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 37.8 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 37.8 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 37.8 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 140.0 mEq/L - (92.0 mEq/L + 37.8 mEq/L) = 10.2 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 10.2 mEq/L.Plugging in 10.2 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 10.2 - 12 = -1.8 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -1.8 mEq/L.Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -1.8 mEq/L / -13.799999999999997 mEq/L = 0.13043.

Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 1-15 points (use 15 - [GCS Score])\n\nThe total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.\n    \nThe patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.\nThe patient is 57.0 years old. Because the patient's age is between 55 and 64, 3 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 3 = 3.\nThe patient note does not report any history on immunocompromise and so we assume this to be false. Hence, 0 points are added to the total, keeping the total at 3 points.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 32.0%.\nBecause the patent's FiO2 percentrage is less than 50%, we need to examine the patient's A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 57.0 mm Hg. Because the patient's partial pressure of oxygen is between 55 and 60 mm Hg, we add three points to the total, making the current total 3 + 3 = 6.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is between 36 and 38.5 degrees celsius, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 6.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 132.0 mm Hg + 2/3 * 103.0 mm Hg = 112.667 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 112.667 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 110 and 129 mmHg, 2 points are added to the score, making the current total, 6 + 2 = 8.\nThe patient's heart rate is 73.0 beats per minute.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 8.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 27.0 breaths per minute.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 25 and 34 breaths per minute, 1 point is added to the score, making the current total, 8 + 1 = 9.\nThe patient's pH is 7.4.\nBecause the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe concentration of sodium is 132.39 mmol/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe concentration of potassium is 4.31 mmol/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe concentration of creatinine is 3.67 mg/dL. The patient is determined to not have an acute renal failure.\nThe patient is determined to have a chronic renal failure.\nBecause the patient has chronic renal failure and a creatinine level above 3.5, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total 9 + 4 = 13.\nThe patient has a hematocrit of 32.0%.\nBecause the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 13.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 12476.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 12476.0 count/\u00b5L of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L which will give 12476.0 white blood cell count count/\u00b5L * 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L = 12476000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 13.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 15. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 15 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 15 = 0. Hence, we add 0 to the total making the current total 0 + 13 = 13.\nHence, the patient's APACHE II score is 13.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Her physical examinations, which included her conjunctiva, cervical lymph nodes, chest, heart and abdomen, revealed normal findings.\nBaseline laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count (WBC) 10 300/\u03bcL\u2191, hemoglobin 12.8 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen 34 mg/dL\u2191, creatinine 4.09 mg/dL\u2191, sodium 128 mEq/L\u2193, potassium 2.6 mEq/L\u2193, chlorides 87 mEq/L\u2193, total protein 7.1 g/dL, albumin 4.2 g/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 0.07 mg/dL, glucose 262 mg/dL\u2191 and \u03b2-glycated hemoglobin 5.9%. Urinalysis revealed protein (1+), sugar (4+) and ketones (+) with no blood cells or casts. Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation, but there were no abnormal findings on chest radiograph or on brain or thoracicoabdominal computed tomography (CT).\nThese findings suggested that her AMS might be caused by one or more conditions, namely, hyponatremia, ketonuria, hyperglycemia and acute kidney injury (uremia), which were presumably due to dehydration, diabetic ketosis and chronic kidney disease. She was hospitalized and treated with electrolytes, including sodium chloride and potassium chloride, and insulin.\nAlthough her blood electrolytes, serum glucose and renal function gradually improved, general conditions, including her consciousness, deteriorated. On the third day after hospitalization, her cognitive function became impaired with reduced conscious levels to E4V3M4 (GCS). Abnormal breaths with apnea and tachypnea accompanied by a fever (37.8\u00b0C) appeared, and glossoptosis was found (Fig. ). Both an oropharyngeal airway and bite block were placed in order to maintain her airway, which is we realized that she suffered from multiple, painful dental caries, but no findings of within the oropharynx.\nLaboratory results on the hospital Day 3 were as follows: WBC 14 800/\u03bcL with 94.1% neutrophils\u2191 and CRP 0.08 mg/dL. There were no abnormal findings on chest radiograph, brain or thoracicoabdominal CT, brain magnetic resonance imaging, or spinal fluid examination.\nBecause no abnormalities were detected in the central nervous system, empiric treatment was initiated with 2.25 g q6hr of piperacillin/tazobactam for fever of unknown origin presumably caused by bacterial infection(s).\nOn hospital Day 6, a dentist examined her teeth and found 15 dental caries, then dental extractions were performed on four teeth. In particular, pus was discharged from the left upper canine with gingival swelling, which was diagnosed with acute apical abscess.\nOn hospital Day 7, her mental status was completely normal (Fig. ), indicating that apical abscess was acute, severe inflammation of the dental pulp with minimal chance of spontaneous recovery [\u2013] and may have caused her AMS and abnormal breathing. Although two sets of blood cultures sampled on hospital Day 3 were negative, bacterial culture from the dental pus sampled on hospital Day 6 yielded methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.

Approximately 1 year prior, he began to visit the pediatric ward of Samsung Medical Center more frequently with symptoms of palpitations and dyspnea lasting 2 to 3 days and occurring in 2- to 3-month intervals. An electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and secundum-type ASD (22.3 mm) with a left-to-right shunt was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Device closure (Amplatzer septal occlude 28 mm; AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN, USA) was then performed; however, 1 week after the procedure, the patient continued to experience dyspnea and chest pain after 10 to 20 minutes of walking. Sustained atrial fibrillation was seen on the electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. Cardioversion was performed following hospitalization with the opinion that the persistent atrial fibrillation was due to device closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital after cardioversion to sinus rhythm at 100 J; however, the symptoms recurred. Since it was difficult to perform radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) due to the recent device closure, the patient was referred to the thoracic surgery department for totally thoracoscopic ablation. Surgery was performed under routine procedures. Intubation was performed using a double lumen endotracheal tube. For the surgery, a 10-mm trocar was inserted in the fourth intercostal space (ICS) of the right anterior axillary line, a 5-mm trocar in the third ICS along the anterior axillary line, and a 10-mm trocar in the sixth ICS on the mid-axillary line. Right pulmonary vein ablation, right ganglionated plexi ablation, and ablation of the right half of the space between the right lower pulmonary vein and the left lower pulmonary vein were performed. Between the procedures, we conducted a high-frequency stimulation test for finding ganglionated plexi. Sutures were placed after chest tube insertion. On the left side, ports were placed in the same positions, and ablations were performed in the same order as on the right side after dividing Marshall\u2019s ligament ().

The patient originally had progressive left proximal lower extremity and bilateral distal upper extremity weakness (left > right) that began several years before the diagnosis was definitively established with a muscle biopsy. The patient's serum creatine phosphokinase concentration was 748 U/L (normal < 170 U/L) at the time of the diagnosis. The patient had several near falls in the months preceding the accident. His left hand and wrist weakness affected his activities of daily living to some degree (fine motor skills), but physical and occupational therapy helped the patient remain active and he continued to live independently with occasional assistance from his wife. Because of worsening left quadriceps weakness, he had recently begun using a cane to help him rise from a seated position. The patient had a history of oropharyngeal dysphagia (solid food, pills) for which he was receiving care from an otolaryngologist. The patient also had chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease that was well controlled with a proton pump inhibitor. He did not have difficulty swallowing liquids and denied respiratory complaints associated with chronic aspiration. The patient did not lose consciousness after striking his head on the stairs and had no new neurological complaints. His other past medical history was notable for coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, chronic low back pain, and vertebral artery stenosis. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery 16 years before the current admission. A previous transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular systolic function. He denied chest pain, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance. The physical examination and radiographs of his femur revealed the left intertrochanteric fracture. The Glasgow coma scale was 15 and there were no new focal neurological deficits. A magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated the small parafalcine subdural hematoma without a cerebral mass effect.\nThe patient was transported to the operating room for repair of the left intertrochanteric fracture. Because primary respiratory failure (, ) resulting, at least in part, from diaphragmatic dysfunction () has been previously reported in patients with IBM and prolonged duration of action of neuromuscular blockers may also occur, the authors opted to avoid the use of a neuromuscular blocker for endotracheal intubation and during maintenance of anesthesia in the current patient.

The concentration of sodium is 130.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 130.0 mEq. To convert from 130.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 130.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 130.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 130.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 130.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 130.0 mmol sodium/L. Plugging in these values into the equation, we get 0.6 * 50.0 * (130.0/140 - 1) = -2.14286 L. The patient's free body water deficit is -2.14286 L.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Electrocardiogram confirmed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Echocardiogram revealed a myopathic severely enlarged left ventricular chamber with moderate concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and severe global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 8 to 10%. The patient's work of breathing and oxygenation improved with Bipap. He was started on diltiazem and diuresis was initiated. The patient was admitted to the step-down unit with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.\nOn hospital day number eight, the overnight nurse found the patient unresponsive. A code blue was called. His initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation and he was shocked with 200 J twice before regaining pulses. When stabilised, he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) where he regained consciousness and full neurologic function within one hour of the event. The following day, an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was placed. Intraoperatively, the patient had runs of ventricular tachycardia with hypotension to 80 mmHg systolic. Postoperatively, the patient was found to have a right fixed mid-dilated pupil, flaccid paralysis of the left arm and leg with hyperreflexia throughout the left side. Computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed a right midbrain and thalamic stroke thought to be secondary to transient arrhythmia-induced hypoperfusion, intraoperatively.\nOn postoperative day number three, after AICD placement and stroke, the patient acutely developed a rigid distended board-like abdomen with dullness to percussion.

This constellation of findings prompted the team to measure an abdominal compartment pressure which was elevated to 53 cm H2O (40 mmHg) with an abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) of 42 mmHg. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed which showed no dilated loops of bowel, no ileus, no evidence of free air, abscess or obstruction and minimal free fluid []. Pertinent labs from the event revealed a lactate of 1.0 mg/dl; lipase, 159 U/l; amylase, 76 U/l; creatinine, 1.53 mg/dl. Surgery was consulted and the FiO2 was increased to 100%, which improved his oxygen saturation to 96% despite his elevated peak inspiratory pressures.\nSurgical recommendations were for an emergent bedside surgical abdominal decompression. The patient was administered 10 mg of intravenous cisatracurium besylate by anaesthesia in preparation for surgical management. Shortly following paralytic administration, his peak inspiratory pressure corrected from 72 to 23 mmHg, his plateau pressure from 48 to 16 mmHg and his oxygenation status tolerated a decrease in FiO2 down to 40% with his oxygen saturation returning to baseline. Measurement of his abdominal compartment pressure revealed a drop from 53 (40 mmHg) to 23 cm H2O (17 mmHg) and then normalised to 15 cm H20 (11 mmHg) over a three-hour period. During this entire event, the patient averaged 100 to 200 cc/hr of urine output and laboratory values from the following day showed a drop in creatinine from 1.53 to 1.29 mg/dl. Given this correction, surgical management was postponed and the patient was monitored. The patient remained hospitalised for an additional 73 days. He was ultimately transferred to a skilled nursing facility without return of symptoms.", "Question": "What is patient's mean arterial pressure in mm Hg? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.", "LLM Answer": "82.67", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "82.66667", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 116.0 mm Hg + 2/3 * 66.0 mm Hg = 82.66667 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 82.66667 mm Hg.", "Result": "Correct"}
