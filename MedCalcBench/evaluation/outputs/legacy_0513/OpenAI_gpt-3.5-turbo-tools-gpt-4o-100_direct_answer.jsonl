Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 1-15 points (use 15 - [GCS Score])\n\nThe total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.\n    \nThe patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.\nThe patient is 67.0 years old. Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.\nThe patient note does not report any history on immunocompromise and so we assume this to be false. Hence, 0 points are added to the total, keeping the total at 5 points.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 50.0%.\nBecause the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 473. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 350 and 500, we add 3 points to the total, making the current total 5 + 3 = 8.\nThe patient's temperature is 38.7 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is between 38.5 and 39 degrees celsius, 1 point is added to the score, making the current total, 8 + 1 = 9.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 138.0 mm Hg + 2/3 * 82.0 mm Hg = 100.667 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 100.667 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe patient's heart rate is 105.0 beats per minute.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe patient's pH is 7.33.\nBecause the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 142.0 mEq. To convert from 142.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 142.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 142.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 142.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 142.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 142.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe concentration of potassium is 4.7 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.7 mEq. To convert from 4.7 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.7 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.7 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.7 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.7 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.7 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 9.\nThe concentration of creatinine is 2.5 mg/dL. The patient is determined to have an acute renal failure.\nThe patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.\nBecause the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level between 2.0 and 3.5, 6 points are added to the score, making the current total 9 + 6 = 15.\nThe patient has a hematocrit of 41.0%.\nBecause the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 15.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 10000.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 10000.0 count/\u00b5L of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L which will give 10000.0 white blood cell count count/\u00b5L * 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L = 10000000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 15.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 13. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 13 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 13 = 2. Hence, we add 2 to the total making the current total 2 + 15 = 17.\nHence, the patient's APACHE II score is 17.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

The skin over the trunk had pink eroded macules, and there were pink patches on the back within a background of dusky necrotic plaques. There were multiple full-thickness epidermal necroses with large areas of bleeding with the denuded skin on the arms and chest in the sun exposed distribution (). Oral mucosae were negative for any oral lesions.\nPatient was found to be pancytopenic with white blood cell count (WBC) 2.03 (Ref: 3.4\u201310.8 \u00d7 103/UL), absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.25 (Ref: 1.4\u20137.0 \u00d7 103/UL), hemoglobin (Hb) 8.8 g/dL (Ref: 11.1\u201315.9 g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) 28.9% (Ref: 34\u201346%), platelet 69 (150\u2013450 \u00d7 103/UL), sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.9 mmol/L, chloride 98 mmol/L, CO2 21 mmol/L, BUN 41 mg/dL (Ref: 6\u201320 mg/dL), Cr 5.49 mg/dL (Ref: 0.57\u20131.0 mg/dL), calcium 7.2 mg/dL (8.7\u201310.2 mg/dL), albumin 3.2 g/dL, phosphorous 5.0 mg/dL (Ref: 1.2\u20132.2 mg/dL), AST 286 IU/L (Ref 0\u201340 IU/L), ALT 31 IU/L (0\u201332 IU/L), total bilirubin 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 136 IU/L, CK 91 U/L, serum lactate was 0.80 mmol/L, and ferritin was 5885 ng/mL (Ref: 15\u201350 ng/mL). Electrocardiogram was consistent with sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray did not show any lung infiltrates or effusions. Ultrasound of the abdomen did not show an acute abdominal process, and the liver demonstrated normal echogenicity, echotexture, and size; the spleen was not enlarged. Sputum gram stain and cultures were unremarkable. Blood cultures were negative for bacteria and yeast. Patient was anuric due to chronic dialysis. Evaluation of lupus activity showed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody 42 IU/mL (Ref: 0\u20139 IU/L). Complement 3 (C3) was 43 mg/dL (Ref: 90\u2013180 mg/dL) and complement 4 (C4) was 9 mg/dL (Ref: 10\u201340 mg/dL). Rheumatoid factor was negative. Sjogren's anti-SSA was >8.0 AI (Ref: 0\u20130.9 AI) and Sjogren's anti-SSB was <0.2 AI (Ref: 0\u20130.9 AI). HIV screen was negative, and viral hepatitis panels for hepatitis A, B, and C were negative. Skin biopsies showed focal interface changes, and periodic acid Schiff (PAS) stain was negative for fungal microorganisms. Gram stain highlighted surface cocci bacteria. VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.", "Question": "Using the Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia formula, what is the patient's corrected calcium in mg/dL?

Abdominal enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed mesenteric lymph node metastasis and multiple low-density lesions in the liver. The capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) scheme was recommended for the neoadjuvant therapy regimen for three cycles. However, even with therapy, the evaluation was progressive disease (PD) given that lymph node and liver lesions continued to grow; thus, surgery was excluded.\nFrom February 2 to October 14, 2017, folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab was implemented for 12 cycles, and the classification was stable disease (SD); bevacizumab plus S-1 was offered as the maintenance treatment.

Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog (NRAS), and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) were wild-type, and mismatch repair proteins were proficient. On May 29, 2018, a peripheral blood sample was assessed for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) with an array of 189 genes to determine whether ras-rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog/v-raf-murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (RAS/RAF) status changed during the past 2 years and EGFR monoclonal antibody could be used as the third-line therapy. The test results showed that KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF were still wild-type. Interestingly, high-level amplification of HER2 (absolute copy number: 63.67) (Figure ) was identified at the same time, which was reported as the resistance mechanism of anti-EGFR therapy previously[-]. Also, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and tumor protein 53 (TP53) alterations were detected, with a mutant allele frequency (MAF) of 7.3% and 9.3%, respectively. IHC for HER2 showed a score of 3+ based on the tumor tissue biopsy obtained on July 22, 2016 (Figure ), while fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed high-level amplification of HER2 (Figure ); thus, the two tests confirmed the results of ctDNA.\nOn March 30, 2018, CT showed that most of the liver lesions were increased compared to January 17, 2018, while new, multiple lesions were detected in the lung.

These symptoms were associated with significant arthralgia affecting her wrists and knees. There were no other associated symptoms. Her family history was negative for lipid disorders, dermatologic conditions, and chronic inflammatory conditions.\nThe physical examination revealed multiple flesh colored to slightly pink, flat-topped, smooth papules lined up in a row in the periungual skin on every finger of both hands, as well as the margin of the nares, forehead, and scalp. The musculoskeletal examination demonstrated unequivocal polyarthritis. There was swelling, loss of range of motion, and pain with movement in both elbows. There was synovial thickening and pain with flexion in both wrists. There were flexion contractures of the second and third proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands. Effusions and synovial thickening were present in both knees.\nLaboratory results showed a normal complete blood count, hepatic profile, renal profile, and lipid profile (cholesterol 128 mg/dL, high density lipoprotein 30 mg/dL, triglycerides 75 mg/dL). Lactate, uric acid, serum sterol, and urine organic acid levels (desmosterol, lathosterol, campesterol and sitosterol) were all within normal limits. ESR and CRP were within normal limits. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed no significant abnormalities. Lyme serology, anti-nuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor were negative. PPD was negative.\nBilateral hand X-rays demonstrated mild diffuse osteopenia without periosteal reaction, soft tissue swelling in the digits, most striking at the base of the fingernails and a radiolucency at the base of the left third proximal phalanx. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis was unremarkable. CT scan of the neck showed multiple, less than 2 cm lymph nodes. A glenohumeral joint effusion was noted as well.\nSkin biopsies were obtained from the nail fold and scalp. The histology sections showed a dome-shape lesion with dermal infiltrate composed of foamy histiocytes and a few admixed lymphocytes (fig ). Multinucleated giant cells and Touton type giant cells were not observed. There was upward migration of cells with clear, foamy, and vacuolated cytoplasm within the overlying epidermis. PAS stains were negative for glycogen deposition and fungal organisms. AFB stains were negative. Immunostaining with CD68 was positive, and CD1a stained only a few intraepidermal and rare dermal cells. Factor XIIIa stained a few scattered cells. These biopsies where read by multiple pathologists as consistent with papular xanthoma. Additional biopsies of synovium and additional skin nodule both showed foamy histiocytes with scattered lymphocytes arranged in sheets. Cytoplasm ranged from clear to bubbly to finely granular. CD68 and lysozyme stained strongly positive in histiocytes. Formal evaluation of the patient by an ophthalmologist, oncologist, and metabolic specialist revealed no additional findings.\nThe child was diagnosed with MRH based on her clinical presentation, even though histopathology was not classic for this disorder, and followed in pediatric rheumatology clinic. She was started on naproxen without major improvement in the joint complaints; methotrexate was then added at a dose of 5 mg (0.4 mg/kg) by mouth once a week and later increased to 7.5 mg (0.6 mg/kg) subcutaneously once a week without major improvement. Hydroxychloroquine 75 mg (6.25 mg/kg) by mouth per day was added. Subcutaneous nodules of about 2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2 cm were noted on the upper portion her arms bilaterally in the region of the axilla and diagnosed as synovial cysts by ultrasound. X ray of the shoulders revealed subtendinous erosion of bone in the humerus and distal clavicle remodeling (fig ). Oral prednisone 1.7 mg/kg/day was started, and there was almost complete resolution of the xanthomatous lesions and moderate improvement in her arthritis. Prednisone was tapered to 1 mg/kg.\nHowever, she continued to have multiple joint effusions and decreased range of motion in her PIP joints. Therefore, etanercept was added at a dose of 20 mg (1.25 mg/kg) subcutaneously every week. Methotrexate was increased to 12.5 mg (0.8 mg/kg). She had a partial initial response to etanercept with some improvement in the range of motion of her MCP's and wrists. However, after 3 months on etanercept, the patient had significant ongoing polyarthritis, so the etanercept dose was increased to 25 mg (1.5 mg/kg), and methotrexate was increased to 15 mg (0.9 mg/kg). As her prednisone was tapered very slowly, a few tiny xanthomatous lesions reappeared. Due to worsening polyarthritis, etanercept was discontinued, and infliximab was started at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously. After 2 infusions given 2 weeks apart, the patient was noted to have improvement with resolution of multiple joint effusions and improved range of motion. In addition, all xanthomas disappeared. The infliximab infusions were continued every 4 weeks. Methotrexate was continued at 0.9 mg/kg subcutaneously per week.

His physical examination revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur in the aortic area with radiation to the precordium, and a 2/6 diastolic murmur over the mitral area without radiation.\nHis initial laboratory investigations showed white blood cell count of 19.2 k/\u03bcL with 93% neutrophils, hemoglobin of 9.6 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 26 mg/dL, creatinine 2.2 mg/dL, serum bicarbonate 16 mmol/L, chloride 112 mmol/L, sodium 136 mmol/L, magnesium 1.2 mmol/L. Prothrombin time was 15 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) was 1.17. Urine toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines. Troponin level was 2.2 ng/mL (normal<0.4). Initial blood cultures were drawn in the emergency department and later grew P. aeruginosa susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and tobramycin. Serology was positive for Hepatitis C infection and negative for HIV infection.\nOn presentation, he was admitted to the intensive care unit with the diagnosis of septic shock. He was started on intravenous vancomycin, tobramycin, micafungin and cefepime.\nThree sets of blood cultures grew C. parapsilosis susceptible to fluconazole, itraconazole and 5 flucytosine, and P. aeruginosa susceptible to amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and tobramycin.\nA 2D echocardiogram showed a bioprosthetic aortic valve with a medium, 10 mm, pedunculated, highly mobile vegetation of the aortic valve attached to the posterior aortic annulus. There was no significant aortic valvular regurgitation. There was mild mitral valvular regurgitation.\nAt day 2 of hospitalization, a transesophageal echocardiogram was done. It showed no aortic abscess but small, 5 mm, mobile vegetation of the aortic valve attached to the non-coronary cusp without significant regurgitation. It also showed large, 10 mm, mobile mitral valve vegetation attached to the anterior leaflet without significant regurgitation.\nThe hospital course was complicated by acute renal failure and acute heart failure for which the patient was aggressively resuscitated. He was electively intubated and medically stabilized to undergo valve replacement 5 days later. Ethical and logistic considerations were the focus of an extensive discussion among the different treating medical and surgical teams given the active injecting drug use while being treated for a relapse of infective endocarditis. The decision was finally made to proceed with the valve replacement surgery. The patient was kept in hospital for the duration of intravenous antibiotics to ensure adherence to therapy and to prevent use of the intravenous access for illicit drug use.\nAt day 7 of hospitalization, he underwent aortic and mitral valve replacement. Cultures from the valves also grew P. aeruginosa and C. parapsilosis. All blood cultures drawn after day 1 were negative.\nTobramycin and cefepime were given for 6 weeks postoperatively. Tobramycin trough levels were measured frequently to ensure therapeutic levels. Micafungin was given for 5 days postoperatively, and replaced by anidulafungin that was given for 26 days. Fluconazole was given for 30 days postoperatively while in hospital and prescribed for 3 months after discharge from the hospital.\nThroughout hospitalization, he remained afebrile and euvolemic without symptoms of heart failure. Two weeks after discharge from the hospital, he returned to the infectious disease clinic, being in good health, without history of fever, excess sweating, chest pain or shortness of breath. Follow-up blood cultures were drawn and were negative.", "Question": "What is the patient's delta ratio? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.", "LLM Answer": "2.14", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "-0.5", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 136.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 112.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 112.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 112.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 112.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 112.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 112.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 16.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 16.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 16.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 16.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L - (112.0 mEq/L + 16.0 mEq/L) = 8.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 8.0 mEq/L.Plugging in 8.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 8.0 - 12 = -4.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -4.0 mEq/L.Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -4.0 mEq/L / 8.0 mEq/L = -0.5. The patient's delta ratio is -0.5.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

She had spent the preceding several weeks in an outside hospital being treated for pneumonia and bacteremia with daptomycin. She subsequently left against medical advice (AMA) after having her dialysis access catheter removed. She presented to our ED because she needed HD vascular access placement and re-initiation of dialysis treatments. Her medical history included chronic kidney disease secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis, anemia, hypertension, deep venous thromboses (DVT), systemic lupus erythematosus, and a seizure disorder of unknown etiology.\nThe patient, a Jehovah\u2019s Witness, refused blood transfusions; therefore, her anemia was being treated with intravenous (IV) administration of iron, epoetin alfa, and folate. Other medications included nifedipine, clonidine, metoprolol, sevelamer, and prednisone. She was allergic to amoxicillin, azithromycin, hydralazine, labetolol, linezolid, morphine, and vancomycin. She reported previous IV heroin use many years earlier and previous cigarette smoking. She denied alcohol use or any current drug or tobacco use.\nUpon arrival, she was alert and in no acute distress with a fever of 38.3\u00b0 Celsius, heart rate of 87 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 110/65 millimeters mercury (mmHg), respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% while breathing room air. She weighed 80 kilograms and was 5 feet 6 inches tall. Her head was normocephalic and atraumatic with moist mucous membranes. Pupils were anicteric, equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. The neck was supple and without lymphadenopathy or tenderness. Her lungs had coarse breath sounds with mild bibasilar crackles but no wheezes or rhonchi. There were no retractions or increased work of breathing. Her heart was of regular rate and rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Her abdomen was soft with normal bowel sounds and without distention, tenderness, rebound, or guarding. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. The lower extremities had 1+ pitting edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses, and were without tenderness or deformity.

These were significant for a slight leukocytosis, anemia to 5.3 g/dL, thrombocytopenia, hyperkalemia, and an elevated creatinine of 11.9 mg/dL. Her initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sinus tachycardia with T-wave inversions in leads I and V6 (). This was unchanged from a prior ECG. The patient was admitted to the medicine team and was started on daptomycin. While awaiting bed placement, a non-tunneled left femoral dialysis catheter was inserted by the medical intensive care unit (ICU) fellow for initiation of HD. Placement was confirmed by the easy drawback of blood from all ports. During the consent process for catheter placement, it was documented that the patient stated she \u201cwould rather die than receive blood transfusions.\u201d Following catheter placement, an attempt was made to start HD, but she became hypotensive and complained of weakness almost immediately. Her vital signs during the initial HD attempt were a blood pressure of 85/56 mmHg with a heart rate of 105 bpm.\nBecause the patient was symptomatic and hypotensive during HD, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was initiated. Shortly afterward, she became hypotensive, unresponsive, and had a tonic clonic seizure. Vital signs at that time were a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure 75/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 78% on room air. A brief, repeat physical exam showed the patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli and her pupils were equal and reactive. She was given 4 mg of lorazepam and intubated for airway protection. A right arterial femoral line and a right femoral triple lumen venous central line were placed. A chest radiograph confirmed endotracheal tube placement (). CRRT was halted but the patient remained in shock despite bolus infusions of crystalloid, so vasopressors were started. She was receiving escalating doses of vasopressors when repeat laboratory values indicated a hemoglobin of 1.6 g/dL ().\nShortly thereafter she went into cardiac arrest with a rhythm of pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after six minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Increased abdominal distention was noted during the resuscitation; therefore, a pressure-sensing urinary catheter was introduced. Her peak airway and bladder pressures were measured at greater than 60 cmH2O and 50 mmHg, respectively. Surgery was then consulted. A massive transfusion protocol was initiated after her next of kin agreed to allow the transfusion of blood products.

Hence, we assume this to be false and so not add any points to the current total keeping it at 71.0.\nNeoplastic disease is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 71.0.\nLiver disease history is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 71.0.\nCHF History is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 71.0 + 10 = 81.0.\nCerebrovascular disease history is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 81.0 + 10 = 91.0.\nRenal Disease History is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 91.0 + 10 = 101.0.\nAltered Mental Status is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 101.0.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 101.0.\nThe patient's pulse is 105.0 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 101.0.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.8 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 101.0.\nThe patient's pH is 7.37. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 101.0.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 19.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 101.0.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 101.0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 22.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 101.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 133.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 133.0 mEq. To convert from 133.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 133.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 133.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 133.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 133.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 101.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 7.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 7.2 mmol. To convert 7.2 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 7.2 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.007 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.007 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 1.261 g glucose. To convert 1.261 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.261 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 1261.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1261.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 126.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 7.2 mmol glucose/L converts to 126.1 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 101.0.\nThe patient's hematocrit is 45.0 %. The patient's hematocrit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 101.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 75.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 101.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 101.0.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 18.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 18.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 18.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 18.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 18.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 121.0 mEq/L - (89.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 14.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 2.6 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 14.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.6 (in g/dL)) = 17.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 17.5 mEq/L.Plugging in 17.5 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 17.5 - 12 = 5.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 5.5 mEq/L.Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 5.5 mEq/L / 6.0 mEq/L = 0.91667.

She had a 2-year history of hypertension controlled by medication, and no history of smoking or alcohol consumption. She had an intermittent cough with white sticky sputum, without any other symptoms or signs. On the same day, the patient was referred to the Fifth Central Hospital of Tianjin. Here vital signs were: body temperature 36.2 \u00b0C, pulse 86 beats/min, respiration rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 142/85 mmHg, and she was fully conscious. There was no visible enlargement of her superficial lymph nodes. She had no cyanosis, percussion pain in the sternum, or abnormal respiratory movements. She had coarse breath sounds in both lungs, no pleural friction sounds, and audible inspiratory crackles in the left lung. Heart sounds were strong and regular, with no pathological murmurs in any valve auscultation area. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was 8 ng/ml (normal range 0\u20135 ng/ml) and non-small cell lung cancer associated antigenCYF21\u20131 was 13.31 ng/ml (normal range 0.1\u20133.3 ng/ml). Other biochemical indicators were within the normal range.\nThe patient underwent a series of imaging examinations (Fig. ). Chest radiography on March 11, 2020 showed several nodules in the upper and lower segments of the left lung (Fig. a). Chest computed tomography (CT) on March 12, 2020 showed multiple solid nodules in the upper and lower left lung (Fig. b). The nodules had irregular outlines, with a maximum diameter of 65 mm, and some had a central cavity. A diagnosis of lymphoma was considered. Enhanced chest CT on March 16, 2020 (Fig. c\u2013e) showed multiple \u201ccauliflower like\u201d, soft tissue masses in the left lung, partially fused, with a maximum diameter of 71.3 mm and a CT value of ~ 36 HU. Enhanced CT showed enhancement with a maximum value of 60 Hu. The boundary between the mass and pleura was not clear, and the mass could not be separated from the pleura. There was irregular thickening of the pleura and no enlargement of lymph nodes. A malignant tumor could not be excluded.\nTo clarify the pathological diagnosis, the patient underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle biopsy of the left lung under local anesthesia on March 16, 2020. After consultation with our own and other hospitals(diagnostics were performed by Tianjin Fifth Central Hospital, Tianjin Cancer Hospital and Peking Union Medical College Hospital), the biopsy specimen was finally diagnosed as BA according to histomorphology and immunophenotype.\nWedge resection with safe margins may be the best treatment option for BA patients. However, if the lung is full of diffuse nodules, the whole lung may need to be removed, which seriously affects quality of life. Our patient was treated conservatively and followed up regularly. She was discharged on March 28, 2020. Her symptoms were managed through regular normal activities of daily living, strengthening respiratory protection, avoiding respiratory infection, and drug treatment to relieve dyspnea and cough.\nTo clarify the diagnosis, a double needle lung biopsy specimen was removed, 15 mm long, 1 mm in diameter. It was solid and gray white. Microscopically, there were irregular adenoid structures in a background of fibrosis and inflammation (Fig. a). The lesion had a two-layer cellular structure consisting of a basal and luminal layer, and had a lack of papillary structures. The micropapillae occasionally formed by non-ciliated cells germinated and burrowed into the alveolar cavity(Fig. b). The luminal layer was composed of type II alveolar cells and club cells. However, ciliated columnar cells and mucous cells in some flat areas could still be identified (Fig. c). The appearance was similar to adenocarcinoma in some areas, with alveolar destruction and stromal widening. Through careful observation, we found that the main reason for the stromal widening was edema and inflammatory infiltration. Unlike adenocarcinoma, there was a lack of thick collagen fibers (Fig. d). Tumor cells lacked atypia, mitosis and necrosis. A layer of material resembling the basement membrane surrounded the basal layer. The most important feature was a continuous layer of basal cells around the luminal layer.\nImmunohistochemical staining for p63, p40 and cytokeratin (CK)5/6 clearly showed the continuity of the basal cells (Fig. a, b). The luminal cells and some basal cells stained positive for thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1. The luminal cells expressed immunological markers of the terminal bronchioles (CKpan, CK7, Napsin A and CEA). A small number of mucous cells stained positive for periodic acid Schiff. The tumor showed a < 10% Ki-67 proliferation index (Fig. ). Finally, the case was pathologically diagnosed as BA of distal type.", "Question": "What is the patient's Centor Score?

He started rosuvastatin (5 mg, once daily) a year ago, with no dose adjustment; the patient was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at the same time. He was recommended levothyroxine treatment but did not initiate treatment because he had no related symptoms or discomfort in his daily life.\nGeneral physical examination revealed dry skin, neck vein distension, nontender diffuse goiter around the neck, and myxedema with puffy face, bilateral periorbital and lower extremities edema. His pulse rate was 52 beats/minute, blood pressure was 114/82 mmHg, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, and his body temperature was 37.1 \u00b0C.

On chest radiography, heart shadow was not blunted without pulmonary infiltration, and cardiomegaly was seen (cardiothoracic ratio, 66%; Fig. a). An electrocardiogram showed bradycardia with normal sinus rhythm and low QRS voltage, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a moderate amount of pericardial effusion (posterior 15 mm) with preserved left ventricular systolic function (55\u201360%; Fig. c). On further investigation, pure tone audiometry revealed that the patient had profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (Fig. a), and thyroid sonography showed diffusely enlarged gland with a heterogeneous echotexture and decreased vascularity (Fig. ); these findings are consistent with Hashimoto thyroiditis together with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies (> 2000 [0\u20135.61] IU/mL) and antithyroglobulin antibodies (9143.72 [0\u20134.11] IU/mL).\nUpon admission, we started aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation to treat rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury and levothyroxine replacement (oral, 150 mcg/day) to treat hypothyroidism. We also started systemic corticosteroids and intratympanic steroid injection to treat sensorineural hearing loss. The patient did not require pericardiocentesis because there was no ventricular dysfunction, and his vital signs were comparatively stable. Over the next several days, the patient\u2019s clinical symptoms, such as shortness of breath, general weakness, and lower limb discomfort, improved substantially. On consecutive laboratory tests, creatine kinase as well as lactate dehydrogenase began to decrease on hospital day (HD) 3 and continued to decline to 1530 IU/L and 1508 IU/L on HD 7, respectively. Creatinine also started to decrease by 1.11 mg/dL on HD 7 accompanied by creatine kinase decline. Further thyroid function testing showed that his TSH was 53.65 \u03bcIU/mL and fT4 was 0.63 \u03bcIU/mL on HD 7.

Because of some technical reasons there was a delay of 45 min before the induction of anaesthesia. During this time, the patient was haemodynamically stable with pulse of 70\u201375/min and BP 120/70 mmHg. At induction, fentanyl citrate 100 mg, propofol 80 mg and vecuronium bromide 6 mg was given to aid intubation.

Injection adrenaline 0.2 mg intravenous bolus, Trendelenberg position, intravenous crystalloids 2\u20132.5 L over the next 2 h and injection hydrocortisone 200 mg intravenous were given. During this time, his systolic blood pressure was between 40 and 60 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure was 25\u201340 mmHg, even after a repeat dose of intravenous adrenaline 0.2 mg. Because the blood pressure was not responding, adrenaline infusion 0.05 mg/kg/min was started. After about 1.5 h, the patient's condition started improving and he became hemodynamically stable. The inotropic support was gradually withdrawn. The patient was mechanically ventilated till the blood pressure stabilized to 100/60 mmHg and pulse rate to 100/min.

His medical history revealed a cardiac fibroma that was detected prenatally. After birth, the fibroma was partially resected twice at another hospital, as the size and extent of the tumor prohibited single-stage resection. Heart transplantation was considered at the time. At the age of 2 years, he experienced cardiac arrest and was admitted to the same hospital. At that time, ventricular tachycardia was repeatedly detected. He developed central nervous system complications, including hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and quadriplegia, after which he had received oral amiodarone. Later, hydrocephalus was detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and he was treated with a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.\nThe patient\u2019s medication was discretionally discontinued at 10 years of age. At 12 years of age, he experienced a cyanotic spell at home and was unable to breathe. He received cardiopulmonary resuscitation from his father. When the rescue squad arrived, they determined that he was in ventricular fibrillation. Defibrillation was performed, and sinus rhythm was restored. The boy was transported to a local hospital where he received endotracheal intubation. Thereafter, he was referred to our hospital, where he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.\nOn admission, the patient\u2019s blood pressure and heart rate were 115/70 mm Hg and 151 beats per minute, respectively. He was intubated and was in a stuporous state. Cardiac murmurs were not heard on chest auscultation. Venous blood gas analysis revealed pH, 7.22; pCO2, 58 mm Hg; pO2, 28 mm Hg; HCO3, 18.9 mmol/L; and SvO2, 39%. Serum biochemical analysis showed a lactate level of 9.25 mmol/L. The levels of serum electrolytes were as follows: sodium, 142 mEq/L; potassium, 3.6 mEq/L; chloride, 109 mEq/L; total calcium, 8.4 mEq/L; ionized calcium, 2.3 mEq/L; inorganic phosphorous, 4.0 mg/dL; and magnesium, 1.7 mg/dL. Serum cardiac enzyme levels were as follows: creatine kinase, 155 IU/L; creatine kinase-MB, 3.37 ng/mL; troponin-T, 0.137 ng/mL; and pro-brain natriuretic peptide, 85.9 pg/ml. Cardiomegaly was observed on chest radiography (). Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with intermittent monomorphic ventricular premature contractions (VPCs). On the 1st day of hospitalization, the patient was supported by mechanical ventilation, without an intravenous inotropic agent. On the 2nd day, VPCs preceded abrupt ventricular fibrillation. He was resuscitated with sinus rhythm restoration following cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation (2 J/kg). Transthoracic echocardiography () and cardiac computed tomography () demonstrated a known fibroma (about 9.5 cm \u00d7 5.5 cm) in the anteroseptal wall of the left ventricle without blood flow obstruction. Soon after, he developed ventricular tachycardia (), and direct current cardioversion was performed along with intravenous amiodarone administration. Additionally, intravenous dopamine was administered for hypotension management. From the third to 9th days of hospitalization, he experience recurrent ventricular tachycardia refractory to multiple (45 times) direct current cardioversions (2 to 4 J/kg) and aggressive administration of antiarrhythmic agents (intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine). Although we suspected that the fibroma induced the arrhythmia, we believed additional partial resection of the tumor would not prevent it. Further, the patient\u2019s poor neurocognitive and psychomotor states posed additional considerations for management. On the 10th day of hospitalization, he underwent an electrophysiology study, and a single-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) generator (Visia AF MRI XT VR SureScan; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with a lead (model 6935M-62cm, Medtronic) attached to the right ventricle was inserted (). On the 11th day, weaning from mechanical ventilation was initiated. Additionally, the intravenous antiarrhythmic agents were discontinued, and oral amiodarone (10 mg/kg/day) and propranolol (0.75 mg/kg/day) were prescribed. On the 18th day, in the absence of an episode of ventricular arrhythmia from ICD memory for five days, he was discharged in stable condition with the ICD generator and followed up in the outpatient clinic.", "Question": "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L?

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 142.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 109.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.9 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 18.9 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 18.9 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 18.9 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 18.9 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 18.9 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 142.0 mEq/L - (109.0 mEq/L + 18.9 mEq/L) = 14.1 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 14.1 mEq/L.Plugging in 14.1 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 14.1 - 12 = 2.1 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 2.1 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Hence, 0 points are added to the total, keeping the total at 2 points.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 48.0%.\nBecause the patent's FiO2 percentrage is less than 50%, we need to examine the patient's A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 76.0 mm Hg. Because the patient's partial pressure of oxygen is more than 70 mm Hg, we do not add any points to the total, keeing the current total at 2.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.5 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is between 36 and 38.5 degrees celsius, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 2.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 124.0 mm Hg + 2/3 * 77.0 mm Hg = 92.667 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 92.667 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 2.\nThe patient's heart rate is 100.0 beats per minute.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 2.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 18.0 breaths per minute.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 2.\nThe patient's pH is 7.32.\nBecause the patient's pH is between 7.25 and 7.32, 2 points are added to the score, making the current total 2 + 2 = 4.\nThe concentration of sodium is 138.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mEq. To convert from 138.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 138.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 138.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 138.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 138.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 4.\nThe concentration of potassium is 4.9 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.9 mEq. To convert from 4.9 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.9 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.9 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.9 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.9 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.9 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 4.\nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL. The patient is determined to not have an acute renal failure.\nThe patient is determined to not have a chronic renal failure.\nBecause the patient's creatinine level is between 0.6 and 1.4, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 4.\nThe patient has a hematocrit of 40.0%.\nBecause the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 4.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 8000.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 8000.0 count/\u00b5L of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L which will give 8000.0 white blood cell count count/\u00b5L * 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L = 8000000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 4.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 15. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 15 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 15 = 0. Hence, we add 0 to the total making the current total 0 + 4 = 4.\nHence, the patient's APACHE II score is 4.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

He was arousable on scene and was transported by the Emergency Medical Services to a local Emergency Department, where he remained awake and alert. He admitted to huffing the Dust-Off, as well as a history of recurrent and heavy hydrocarbon huffing. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was obtained and revealed sinus tachycardia with a prolonged QTc of 472 milliseconds (). The patient was transferred to a regional burn unit for frostbite on his hand due to refrigerant exposure.\nWhile in the burn unit, the patient had a generalized seizure and went into cardiac arrest. Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocol was initiated. The patient was found to be in a torsades de pointes rhythm () and was given magnesium. He was intubated, resuscitated, and sent to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit where he was placed on fentanyl and midazolam drips and continuously monitored. Episodes of hypotension and tachycardia were noted, as well as right bundle branch block on repeat ECG. He was started on multiple vasopressors and given amiodarone for dysrhythmias. Hypocalcemia (5.6 mg/dL) was treated with calcium gluconate boluses and resolved.\nPertinent medical history included multiple psychiatric admissions and tobacco and prior alcohol abuse. The patient was homeless and unemployed. Possible outpatient medications included multiple antidepressants and sedatives, but compliance was unknown.\nAt the time of toxicology consultation approximately 24 hours after presentation, physical exam revealed a young white male, intubated, arousable but easily agitated. Vital signs included a heart rate of 106, blood pressure of 110/67, respiratory rate of 14 per minute, and 100% oxygen saturation on the ventilator. Maximum temperature was noted to be 103.5 degrees Fahrenheit, with a temperature of 99.3 degrees Fahrenheit at consultation. His pupils were 3 mm and reactive to light. He was tachycardic with a regular rhythm. The remainder of the exam was benign with no appreciable neurological deficits, rigidity, or clonus.\nInitial chemistry panel revealed creatinine of 1.55 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mmol/L, chloride of 103 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 16 mmol/L, potassium of 3.5 mmol/L, magnesium of 3.0 mg/dL. AST was mildly elevated at 64 U/L with an ALT of 48 U/L. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH of 7.38, pCO2 of 37 mmHg, pO2 of 80 mmHg, HCO3 of 22 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation at 94% prior to intubation.

You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.", "LLM Answer": "2.43", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "0.875", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 138.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 138.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 103.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 103.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 103.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 103.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 103.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 103.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 16.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 16.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 16.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 16.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (103.0 mEq/L + 16.0 mEq/L) = 19.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 19.0 mEq/L.Plugging in 19.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 19.0 - 12 = 7.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 7.0 mEq/L.Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 7.0 mEq/L / 8.0 mEq/L = 0.875.

Microbiological examination was not performed at that time. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 875/125 mg twice daily for 5 days was prescribed empirically. The symptoms of tonsillitis resolved within five-day treatment, however, four days after completing the course of antibiotic therapy, sore throat, more prominent on the left side, reappeared. Two days later the patient presented to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of worsening sore throat, painful swallowing and fever. The patient was previously well, with no history of chronic diseases, recurrent tonsillitis or previous peritonsillar abscess. Seven months previously she gave birth to her second child and was still breastfeeding the baby. She denied smoking. On physical examination her temperature was 38\u00b0C, pulse rate: 80 beats/min, respiratory rate: 22 breaths/min and blood pressure: 120/80 mm Hg. Examination of the oral cavity and oropharynx showed enlarged and inflamed left tonsil as well as congested and bulging soft palate on the left side with contralateral displacement of the uvula. Both tonsils were covered with whitish exudate. No dental caries was noted. There was also bilateral, moderately tender submandibular lymphadenopathy. The remainder of physical examination was unremarkable. Blood tests results are shown in Table . Separate swabs were obtained from the surfaces of both tonsils. Next, under local anesthesia, diagnostic needle aspiration of left tonsil was performed by otolaryngologist, during which scanty amount of pus was obtained. This initial procedure was followed by incision and drainage. Tonsil swabs and abscess aspirate were sent to laboratory for microbiological examination. The patient refused hospitalization at the Otolaryngology Department, thus was discharged home on a 10-day course of cefuroxime (500 mg twice daily) and metronidazole (500 mg 3 times daily) with recommendation to discontinue breastfeeding for the duration of the antibiotic therapy and to present at follow-up visit to Otolaryngology Clinic after completing antibiotic therapy. The symptoms of peritonsillar abscess as well as fever were subsiding steadily during treatment, however on the last day of antibiotic therapy, swelling and pain of the left ankle appeared, thus the patient presented to her family doctor. Upon presentation she was afebrile and had marked oedema and pain of her left ankle. Her heart rate was 72 beats/min, she did not have an appreciable cardiac murmur. Her chest was clear to auscultation. Antibiotic therapy with cefuroxime (500 mg once daily) for next 5 days was prescribed, as well as pain relief medication with paracetamol. After completing antibiotic therapy the patient presented at follow-up visit to Otolaryngology Clinic. She was afebrile, with normal vital signs. Examination of oropharynx showed resolution of both, congestion and oedema of left tonsil and soft palate. There was no exudate on the tonsils. Cultures of throat swabs and abscess aspirate collected 2 weeks before revealed the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes in all three materials. According to the patient report, left ankle swelling with which she presented to her family doctor, resolved within 4 days. Upon presentation the patient only had moderate pain in the joint. She was consulted by rheumatologist. Her heart rate was 70 beats/min. She did not have a regurgitant murmur. Her chest was clear to auscultation. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer was evaluated and proved to be 412 IU/ml (normal 0\u2013200 IU/ml). The level of C-reactive protein was 13,0 mg/L. Control throat swabs were collected for culture, which revealed normal oropharynx flora. The patient was recommended to continue pain relief medication with paracetamol and present at follow-up visit to Rheumatology Clinic after 2 weeks. Her only complaint was persisting slight pain in left ankle joint. The results of physical examination were analogous to those observed at previous follow-up. ASO titer was 503 IU/ml. Control throat swabs were collected and culture yielded normal flora. The patient was recommended to present at follow-up visit at Rheumatology Clinic after 2 months. At that time, she was well. Ankle pain, according to the patient report, disappeared shortly after last visit. The results of physical examination were analogous to those observed previously. ASO titer was 396 IU/ml. Six months after the presentation at Emergency Department, the patient was well, with ASO titer reaching 262 IU/ml. Table summarizes the chronology of clinical findings and blood tests results.\nCultures of PTA aspirate revealed Streptococcus pyogenes as a predominant species as well as Prevotella oralis and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Tonsil swabs, collected at the time the patient presented with PTA, yielded copious growth of Streptococcus pyogenes as well as normal throat flora, namely Streptococcus viridians, Neisseria spp, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Two control throat swabs revealed only normal oropharynx flora. Bacterial species were identified with the use of routine microbiological methods, drug susceptibility of S. pyogenes was assessed using Vitek 2 Compact (bioM\u00e9rieux). Antimicrobial susceptibility results were interpreted according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing recommendations (EUCAST 2013, version 3.1) []. Streptococcus pyogenes strains isolated from tonsil swabs and abscess aspirate demonstrated identical susceptibility patterns. They were resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline and fully susceptible to all other antibiotics tested.

A recent echocardiogram showed left ventricular hypokinesis consistent with an ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20 to 25%. Previous magnetic resonance imaging showed a 9x11x16 mm meningioma, without metastasis, edema or hydrocephalus. Her medications included verapamil, timolol, and diazepam.\nThe initial assessment by paramedics at 1320 described an alert and appropriate patient with pupils equal, round and reactive; the breathing was not labored, lungs were clear, and finger stick glucose was 139. The rhythm was ventricular tachycardia. Paramedics gave 50mg lidocaine intravenous (IV) push, with resolution of the tachycardia to a narrow complex sinus rhythm at a rate of 80 beats per minute. The rhythm was stable for one to two minutes, then recurred. They administered a second dose of lidocaine 50mg IV push, resulting in resolution of the tachycardia to a sinus rate of 78 beats per minute. The patient reported a decrease in shortness of breath and some mild dizziness. Paramedic personnel initiated a lidocaine drip at 2mg/minute for transport to the emergency department (ED).\nIn the primary ED, 28 minutes later, the patient had a ventricular rate of 152 beats per minute. She received a third 50mg dose of lidocaine IV. Her electrocardiogram (EKG) revealed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and an anteroseptal infarct of indeterminate age. At 1413 the physician increased the lidocaine drip to 4mg/minute, and administered aspirin 325mg by mouth. Shortly thereafter, the patient received a loading dose of amiodarone 150mg IV, followed by an amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. She then came via EMS to our hospital.\nEn route emergency medical service personnel noted the patient to be in normal sinus rhythm with ventricular ectopy. The lidocaine drip remained at 4mg/minute and the amiodarone drip at 1mg/minute. The IV pump delivering amiodarone failed 20 minutes into the transfer and the medication discontinued. During transfer the report notes that the patient complained of \u201cbeing sleepy\u201d but was alert and appropriate. Six minutes prior to arrival the patient\u2019s mental status changed abruptly.

Her weight was 49 kilograms. Her airway was patent. The EKG monitor showed normal sinus rhythm. The patient was unresponsive to painful stimuli with pupils 4mm and nonreactive with intact gag reflex. Plantar reflexes were neutral. Given the patient\u2019s abrupt change in mental status, brainstem stroke was considered and we consulted neurology. We ordered an expedited computerized tomographic scan (CT) of the head 19 minutes after arrival. Two minutes later she received 0.4mg naloxone intraveniously and the lidocaine drip was discontinued. The patient\u2019s National Institute of Health (NIH) stroke score was 24, indicating severe neurologic impairment.\nInitial imaging studies included a chest x-ray with the only abnormality being an enlarged cardiac silhouette. CT scan of the head revealed mild microvascular ischemic changes. An 11 mm partially calcified right falcine mass was consistent with a stable meningioma.

The patient is reported to not be using continuous positive airway pressure.

To convert 130.0 \u00b5mol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 130.0 \u00b5mol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.00013 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00013 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.015 g creatinine. To convert 0.015 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.015 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.0 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.0 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.5 mg creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 130.0 \u00b5mol creatinine/L converts to 1.5 mg creatinine/dL. The patients urine output is 910 mL/day.\n\nBecause the patient's creatinine concentration is at least 1.2 mg/dL, but less than 2.0 mg/dL, we increment the score by one point, making the current total 6 + 1 = 7.\nHence, the patient's SOFA score is 7 points.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA) (Tc 99m) scan confirmed the absence of tracer uptake in the left kidney. Urine examination showed 2\u20133 rbc/hpf, no pus cells, and absent protein. Lipid profile showed elevated LDL (190 mg/dL), 2D ECHO was normal, and cardiac monitoring did not reveal arrhythmia. The serum C3 and C4 were normal. Protein C, protein S, anti-thrombin III were within normal range & factor V Leiden mutation, and APLA antibodies were negative. The fundus examination did not reveal retinal infarction. Computed tomography head did not reveal any area of infarction. Left nephrectomy was performed. In view of hyperhomocysteinemia, the patient was started on tab folic acid (10 mg/day). His serum creatinine reduced to 1.1 mg/dL, and he was discharged on warfarin and folic acid.\nOne week after getting discharged, the patient now developed right-sided flank pain associated with vomiting and decreased urine output, with no c/o fever, or chest pain. On physical examination, he had a BP of 154/100 mm Hg and a mild right lumbar and pelvic tenderness. Non-contrast CT abdomen did not show any significant abnormality. His creatinine increased to 3.2 mg/dL within 24 hrs. The INR was 2.1, and the DTPA scan now showed reduced tracer uptake in the right kidney. The ultrasound renal doppler showed resistive flow in the right renal segmental artery. The patient was restarted on anticoagulation (heparin 1000 IU/hr). His creatinine increased to 9.0 mg/dL, and he became anuric. He was started on hemodialysis and a repeat CT renal angiography [] was suggestive of right renal segmental artery thrombosis with multiple renal infarcts. Urgent renal angiography and intra-arterial thrombolysis were done with alteplase, infused intravenously as an initial dose of 5 mg over 10 min, followed by 1 mg/hr for 36 hrs. He was continued on heparin (500 IU/hr) to avoid clotting in the arterial sheath. Check renal angiography revealed improved blood flow in the thrombosed vessel []. The patient required alternate day hemodialysis. Subsequently, in the next 2 weeks, the patient's urine output started improving gradually. After 3 weeks, the patient had 2.0 L/day of urine output, and his creatinine decreased to 2.8 mg/dL. In his family, his father had undergone coronary reperfusion (Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)) at the age of 45 years. His grandfather and grandmother died due to myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. On further investigations, the patient's thrombophilic profile revealed plasminogen activator inhibitor factor deficiency, and genetic mutation studies revealed a methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation. These two defects predisposed him to a thrombotic state. His paternal aunt and uncle both were also found to have elevated homocysteine levels but no thrombotic event so far. The genetic analysis for hyperhomocysteinemia did not reveal any mutations in other family members. He was discharged on heparin (5000 IU twice per day), folic acid, aspirin, and statin. His serum creatinine came down to 2.4 mg/dL. It was proposed to start novel anticoagulants.", "Question": "What is the patient's HAS-BLED score?

He had no other underlying chronic disease. He was an ex-smoker (20 pack-years) and did not have a history of alcohol abuse. His vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 140/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 68 beats per minute; respiratory rate, 20 per minute; and body temperature, 38.5\u2103. Auscultation revealed coarse crackles in both lower lung fields.\nChest radiography showed multiple pulmonary infiltrations in the right lung fields (). White blood cell count was 8,000/mm3 with 76.0% segmented neutrophils, 13.7% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin were 23.34 mg/dL and 0.579 mg/dL, respectively. Other routine blood chemistry tests were all normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.439, PCO2 36.3 mm Hg, PO2 52.4 mm Hg, and HCO3- 24.9 mmol/L.\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed, and revealed multiple pulmonary consolidations, ground-glass opacities, and interstitial septal thickenings in both lower lung fields (). Based on these observations, we made a diagnosis of CAP and initiated antimicrobial therapy of intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g plus azithromycin 500 mg. After treatment of CAP, the clinical findings of the patient stabilized, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 4.\nAfter three months, we performed a routine check-up of the patient. The patient had no definitive symptoms. Follow-up chest radiography showed resolution of multiple pulmonary consolidations throughout most of the lung fields, but a mass-like lesion without the loss of right cardiac borders at the right lower lobe field was observed (). Follow-up CT scans of the chest revealed interval improvements in pneumonic consolidations in both lower lung fields, but an increased mass in the right posterior mediastinum at T6-7 level that we had considered to be pneumonic consolidations on the previous CT scans was visible (). This oval and elongated mass with mild enhancement of soft tissue density without any bone destruction was observed (). Positron emission tomography using 2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) imaging and CT scans of the whole body except the brain revealed mild FDG uptake of maximum standardized uptake value 3.4 at the posterior mediastinal mass.\nPercutaneous needle biopsy using ultrasound was performed. Lung ultrasound revealed an ill-defined, hypoechoic subpleural lesion measuring about 5.0 cm\u00d72.7 cm at right paraspinal area of T6-7 level. And microscopic examination showed diffuse infiltrates of polymorphous and asynchronous plasma cells with large and eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant cytoplasm (). Immunohistochemistry revealed the biopsy was positive for CD138, the cytoplasm was diffusely reactive for monoclonal kappa-light chain (). Based on these findings, the posterior mediastinal mass was diagnosed as a IgG kappa type plasmacytoma.\nWe subsequently investigated the possibility of multiple myeloma. Laboratory tests showed an inverse albumin/globulin ratio (total protein, 10.7 g/dL; albumin, 3.0 g/dL; A/G ratio, 0.38). Serum hemoglobin, creatinine, and total calcium were 11.8 g/dL, 1.4 mg/dL, and 8.5 mg/dL, respectively. Immunofixation of serum showed monoclonal gammopathy of IgG-kappa type. In serum protein electrophoresis, the M spike level was 4.58 g/dL. Serum Ig determination revealed a markedly increased IgG level (6,993.1 mg/dL), and the level of \u03b22-microglobulin was 3,674.2 ng/mL.

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 135.0 mEq. To convert from 135.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 135.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 135.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 135.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 135.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 135.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 3.\nThe concentration of potassium is 4.6 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.6 mEq. To convert from 4.6 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.6 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.6 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.6 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.6 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.6 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 3.\nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.8 mg/dL. The patient is determined to not have an acute renal failure.\nThe patient is determined to have a chronic renal failure.\nBecause the patient has chronic renal failure and a creatinine level between 1.5 and 2.0, 2 points are added to the score, making the current total 3 + 2 = 5.\nThe patient has a hematocrit of 41.0%.\nBecause the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 5.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 7500.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 7500.0 count/\u00b5L of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L which will give 7500.0 white blood cell count count/\u00b5L * 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L = 7500000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 3x10^9/L, but less than 15 x10^9/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 5.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 13. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 13 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 13 = 2. Hence, we add 2 to the total making the current total 2 + 5 = 7.\nHence, the patient's APACHE II score is 7.", "Result": "Correct"}

He denied both a history of traveling and contact with animals over the previous 3 months. Associated symptoms included general malaise, anorexia, and the loss of 6 kg body weight within the previous 2 months. On admission, the vital signs were shown as blood pressure: 124/68 mmHg; pulse rate: 80/min; respiratory rate: 22/min; body temperature: 38.5\u00b0C. Physical examination revealed a pansystolic murmur over the apex and left lower sternal border. An abscess in a molar cavity that required debridement was found, although the patient had not complained of dental pain. Laboratory tests revealed a WBC count of 9250/\u03bcL with elevated neutrophils (82.7%); normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL; an elevated ESR level (123 mm/1 hr); and abnormal liver function with AST/ALT of 49/79 IU/L. A chest x-ray film revealed increased infiltration over the right upper and lower lobes, and abdominal sonography showed mild splenomegaly. Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis was excluded by negative results from serial acid-fast stain and culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a vegetation with size of 0.9 cm over the anterior leaflet of mitral valve, and moderate mitral regurgitation. However, the cardiac systolic and diastolic functions were normal with the ejection fraction of 78.9%, fraction shortening of 47.8%. Ultimately, definite subacute endocarditis was diagnosed according to the Duke criteria, including two blood culture results of B. vesicularis; the presence of vegetation on the mitral valve revealed by an echocardiogram (Fig. ); and such clinical and laboratory features as fever, splenomegaly, heart murmur, anemia, Osler's node (Fig. ),,and Roth's spot (Fig. ).\nThe pathogen was identified as B. vesicularis on the basis of the biochemical characteristics tested by the API ID 32 GN automatic identification system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy I' \u00c9toile, France). These included the characteristics of positive activity of D-maltose/D-glucose oxidation; negative activity of inositol/D-sorbitol/L-arabinose oxidation; negative activity of L-alanine/capric acid/potassium 5-ketogluconate/trisodium citrate decarboxylation; negative activity of nitrate reduction and indole production. The organism was susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, aztreonam, cefepime, meropenem, netilmicin, ampicillin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, cefazolin, cefmetazole, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ticarcillin, according to the susceptibility test performed by the disc diffusion method with interpretation criteria for Pseudomonas []. The patient was treated with a combination of cefazolin (2 gm/8 hr) and gentamicin (80 mg/8 hr) as empiric antibiotics during the first 3 days and fever subsided gradually.\nAmpicillin/sulbactam (3 gm/6 hr) was used alternatively for covering the infection of oral anaerobes while the patient underwent removal of the abscessed tooth. Treatment with amipicillin/sulbactam failed, however; the patient developed a flare-up of fever, the appearance of a new Osler's node on the fourth digit of the left hand (Fig. ), and pain in the right femur with right inguinal lymphadenopathy. Treatment with a combination of ceftriaxone (2 gm/12 hr) and gentamicin (80 mg/8 hr) was administered subsequently. The femoral-inguinal symptoms and fever improved gradually with the antimicrobial therapy and therefore were ascribed to embolism. Although the clinical symptoms and signs improved after use of these antibiotics, ciprofloxacin (400 mg/12 hr) was administered as an alternative due to the eruption of a skin rash from an allergic reaction after 7 days' treatment with ceftriaxone.

RA had been diagnosed at another hospital in 1972 when she presented with bilateral arthropathy of the hands, knees, ankles, and feet. Treatment was started with a combination of a gold preparation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but was not been effective. Prednisolone (PSL; 15 mg daily) and bucillamine (BUC; 200 mg daily) were started in 1987, but her disease remained active. Methotrexate (MTX; 5 mg daily) was started in 1995 but was discontinued because of nausea. In 2002, urinary protein was found to be positive by a dipstick urine test, and BUC was stopped. Then treatment was continued with PSL (5 mg/day) and loxoprofen (50 mg/day). However, urinary protein excretion increased in 2007, and serum creatinine (Cre) was elevated to 1.96 mg/dL.\nOn admission, the patient was 154.2 cm tall and weighed 44.0 kg, with a blood pressure of 128/60 mmHg and temperature of 36.4 \u00b0C. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormalities of the heart and lungs. The joints of her hands, knees, ankles, and feet showed bilateral swelling and deformity. In addition, the lower extremities were edematous. Her cervical spine was unstable, with flexion causing numbness in the upper limbs.\nLaboratory findings were as follows: serum Cre was 4.2 mg/dL, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 9.3 mL/min/1.73m3, C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.9 mg/dL, and SAA was 43.2. In addition, rheumatoid factor (RF) was positive at 59 U/mL (normal: < 10), and cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies were positive at 218.5 (normal < 4.5). 24-hour urinary protein excretion was 6.5 g, and the urine sediment contained 1 \u2013 5 red cells per high-power field (HPF). The disease activity score (DAS)-CRP was 7.1. Radiographs showed deformation of the finger and foot joints as well as atlantoaxial joint subluxation. Renal biopsy was performed for evaluation of her kidney disease.\nRenal biopsy\nLight microscopic examination of a biopsy specimen containing 4 glomeruli revealed global sclerosis in all 4. There was severe tubular atrophy, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis occupied ~ 95% of the entire renal cortex. All 4 glomeruli contained multinodular structures of amorphous material with a PAM-positive border. This material was positive for Congo-red and amyloid A, but was negative for \u03ba and \u03bb chains, \u03b2-2 microglobulin, and transthyretin (). Electron microscopy showed randomly arranged fibrils measuring 8 \u2013 12 nm in diameter corresponding to the amyloid deposits (f). AA amyloidosis was diagnosed from these findings. In addition to the glomeruli, amyloid deposits were mainly observed in the interlobular artery walls and tubulointerstitium (e). Endoscopic biopsy of the stomach, duodenum, and colon revealed AA-positive deposits in the small arteries and tissues of the submucosal layer (a).\nClinical course\nPSL was discontinued, and administration of a soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor inhibitor (etanercept; 25 mg every 2 weeks) was started in May 2008, but it was not effective. By September 2008, Cre was increased to 6.0 mg/dL. She underwent surgery to prepare an arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. Etanercept was discontinued, and a humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody (tocilizumab; 8 mg/kg = 360 mg/month) was started in February 2009. After 3 months, her CRP decreased to 0.0 mg/dL, and the DAS28-CRP sore was 2.12. After 2 years of tocilizumab therapy, urinary protein excretion was decreased to 1.1 g/day, and Cre was 4.0 mg/dL. Subsequently, Cre remained in the range of 4.5 \u2013 5.0 mg/dL until December 2017. While Cre increased to 7.1 mg/dL after initiation of treatment with denosumab (a human monoclonal antibody that binds to receptor activator of NF\u03baB ligand) for osteoporosis in October 2018, it remained at 7.0 mg/dL in June 2019 ().\nGastroduodenal biopsy was performed in May 2013 and May 2017.

At that time, the patient presented a history of hypertension since the age of 42, hypoacusia, a superficial venous thrombosis event, and incidental evidence of cerebral ischemia.\nBlood and urine tests revealed a IIIb CKD stage renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 1.92 mg/dL, MDRD GFR 39 mL/min/1.73 mq) with mild proteinuria (0.821 g/24 h). Urine sediment was clear. A kidney biopsy was performed to explore renal disease etiology, showing non-specific advanced chronic lesions (global glomerulosclerosis in 70% of glomeruli and segmental glomerulosclerosis in 10% of glomeruli, moderate interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy, and severe arteriolosclerosis). Therapy with ACE-inhibitor was hence started.\nTwo years later, at the age of 57, a significant concentric LVH (basal septum region 18 mm) was detected during an echocardiographic evaluation for hypertension.\nRenal follow-up showed a progressive decline in renal function reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at the patient\u2019s age of 61. Chronic peritoneal dialysis was started, and one year later, he underwent renal transplantation from a deceased donor without complications.\nWhen the patient was 63 years old, he began complaining of dyspnea during intense exercise.

The left ventricular mass index was 198.4 g/m2. Extensive late gadolinium enhancement was also detected in the infero-lateral wall, with an increased T2 value indicating myocardial edema ().\nAn initial 24-h Holter monitoring revealed two runs of atrial fibrillation, which required the introduction of anticoagulant therapy.\nOne year later, in 2020, two runs of monomorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia were detected during a further 24-h Holter monitoring.

The exception was his pH of 7.21. The patient was started on four liters nasal cannula, switched to non-rebreather as he remained hypoxic, and was subsequently admitted to the hospital for further management.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 134.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 134.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 134.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 134.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 134.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 134.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 105.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 105.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 105.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 105.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 105.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 105.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 134.0 mEq/L - (105.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.Plugging in 12.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 12.0 - 12 = 0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 0 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

He had right-sided hemiparesis, muscle strength was diminished, MRC (Medical Research Council) grade muscle strength was 4/5 power and Babinski sign was present on the right. Right limbs showed incoordination and there was loss of pain and temperature sensation on the right side of his face and left side of his body. The finger-nose test and heel-knee-tibia test revealed ataxia on the right side of his body. Neurological findings suggested that right hemiparesis accompanied the typical findings of LMS (). The rest of the exam was unremarkable. Laboratory blood tests showed no other abnormalities except mildly elevated levels of urea and creatinine. No pathological findings were detected in computed tomography of the brain. DWI of MR imaging of the brain showed acute ischemic infarction of the right dorsolateral medulla. The area of infarction extends anteriorly within the medulla. Oxygen (2\u20133 L/min) was delivered through a T-piece in tracheostomy. rt-PA was administered in compliance with the standard dose, 0.9 mg/kg. Then antiplatelet treatment (asprin and clopidogrel) and statin were initiated. The cranial and cervical magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealed advanced stenosis in the basilar artery and right vertebral artery (). Further digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed this (). Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) and aneurysms were excluded.\nThe patient gradually improved and was discharged with remarkable improvements after 2 weeks after conventional treatment for lateral medullar infarction. He had a 90% improvement in pain intensity and frequency from brief pain inventory. He was fully conscious without diplopia and nystagmus, eating by himself, and walking independently for a short distance, although unsteady. The symptoms of headache resolved 1 month later. After 5 months, an MRI brain scan and a MRA of the cerebral circulation were performed for follow up. High resolution MR images of the wall of the vertebrobasilar artery showed localized stenoses of both vertebral arteries due to unstable appearing atheromatous plaque (). One year later the patient still had some residual neurological symptomatology, including a mild deficit in pain and temperature sensation on the right side of his face and left side of body, mild dizziness, right face anhydrosis, mild right limbs numbness, and widened step base.

The hepatitis B marker was negative and the anti HCV antibody was positive. A hepatitis C viral load was undetectable. The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) pantoprazole, IV terlipressin and IV ciprofloxacin and was transfused with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells. Emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed the presence of grade 2 esophageal varices without stigmata of recent bleeding. No bleeding focus was found at colonoscopy up to the terminal ileum. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed liver cirrhosis with massive ascites, splenomegaly and esophagogastric varices with portosystemic collaterals. In addition, CT angiography revealed the presence of jejunal varices but no active bleeding was found (). Because she continued experiencing recurrent melena, a capsule endoscopy was performed on day five of hospitalization. It demonstrated fresh blood adjacent to varices in the jejunum (). On day six of hospitalization, a decision was made to perform the embolization of varices via the portal vein. The guidewire was manipulated into the superior mesenteric vein and the catheter tip was then positioned into tortuous, wide jejunal varices drained to the inferior vena cava. Five steel coils were placed into this vein. After that, injection of contrast under pressure did not demonstrate any retrograde flow, indicating that it was occluded ().\nShe received up to 21 units of packed red blood cells before the coiling embolization of the jejunal varices. Since that point in time, she has had a stable hemoglobin level and no recurrence of the melena has been recognized. She has been treated with a non-selective beta-blocker.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 129.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 129.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 129.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 129.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 129.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 99.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 99.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 99.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 99.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 99.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 99.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 18.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 18.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 18.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 18.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 18.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 18.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 129.0 mEq/L - (99.0 mEq/L + 18.0 mEq/L) = 12.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 12.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 28.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 28.0 g albumin/10.0 dL = 2.8 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 28.0 g albumin/L converts to 2.8 g albumin/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 12.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 2.8 (in g/dL)) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Past history included long-term use of intravenous drugs, extensive and current alcohol use with evidence of cirrhosis based on laboratory findings, and imaging and seropositivity for hepatitis C antibody without measurable viremia. He also had a history of sustaining an upper abdominal stab wound requiring exploratory laparotomy in the early 1990s. He denied fevers, rigors, night sweats, weight loss, or skin rashes.\nInitial evaluation revealed an ill appearing man with tachycardia (heart rate 120 beats/min) with mild hypotension (blood pressure 85\u2013105/50\u201360 mmHg), and tachypnea (respiratory rate 20\u201325/min) requiring 2 L/min supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain a blood oxygen saturation >95 %. He had distant heart sounds with tachycardia and regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops. He had jugular venous distension with a positive Kussmaul\u2019s sign and pulsus paradoxus. There was significant abdominal distention present with a fluid wave. He had stigmata of chronic liver disease with spider angiomata noted and collateral venous distension in the abdominal wall. Furthermore, he had scrotal swelling and bilateral lower extremity edema. He was admitted to the hospital\u2019s Medicine Service.\nOn admission, a chest radiograph revealed enlargement of the cardiac silhouette (Fig. ). A bedside echocardiogram illustrated a large pericardial effusion with evidence of hemodynamic compromise, including right atrial and right ventricular diastolic collapse, a >30 % respiratory variability in the tricuspid and mitral valve flow rates, and a swinging cardiac motion consistent with the presence of cardiac tamponade demanding urgent intervention.\nAdmission laboratory values revealed a normal white blood cell count, a mild macrocytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume 95 fL) with a hemoglobin of 12.1 g/dL, a hematocrit of 36 %, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 84,000/\u03bcL. Tests of liver function revealed serum concentrations of albumin of 2.2 g/dL (N > 3.5 g/dL), total bilirubin of 3.1 mg/dL, with direct bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL, an aspartate aminotransferase of 83 U/mL, an alanine aminotransferase of 37 U/mL, an alkaline phosphatase of 106 U/mL (upper limits of normal 150 U/mL), and a \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase of 48 U/mL (upper limits of normal <98 U/L). Studies of coagulation revealed an elevated prothrombin time (PT) of 21 s and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.87. Abdominal paracentesis revealed a serum albumin-to-ascites gradient (SAAG) >1.1 g/dL, and a total protein concentration of <2.5 g/dL, consistent with portal hypertension: The total white blood cell count was 220/mm3, with 22 % neutrophils. These results were compatible with the diagnosis of an uninfected ascites due to portal hypertension as a probable consequence of his cirrhosis. The initial chest radiograph revealed cardiomegaly, bilateral pulmonary edema, and minimal pleural effusions (Fig. ). Ultrasound scan of the right upper quadrant revealed a nodular liver consistent with cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension such as mild splenomegaly and large volume ascites with no space-occupying lesion was identified. Admission pericardiocentesis had an opening pressure of 20 mmHg and, after removal of 1.5 L of serous pericardial fluid and placement of a drain, a closing pressure of 9 mmHg. Pericardial fluid analysis revealed protein concentrations and other characteristics identical to those found in the ascitic fluid: All pericardial cultures were negative, and no organisms were seen. Otherwise, the echocardiogram was relatively normal, as was cardiac function. Over the succeeding 24 h, 3 L of fluid drained from the pericardial sac, as did an additional 3 L during the subsequent 24-h period. It was suspected that ascitic fluid was exiting through the pericardial drain.\nDuring investigation, a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 28 mm/h and serum concentrations of C-reactive protein of 1.1 mg/dL, creatine phosphokinase of 101 U/L, aldolase of 6.1 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase of 398 U/L were all noted. Serum lipids and triglycerides were unremarkable. Investigation for the etiology of chronic liver disease revealed a serum ferritin of 113 ng/mL, negative anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, and anti-liver kidney microsomal antibodies, and negative virologic evidence for hepatitis A or B. Hepatitis C Ab was positive, but serum hepatitis C virus was undetectable. Serum \u03b1-1 anti-trypsin and ceruloplasmin, serum copper, and TSH concentrations were normal. Serological investigations for a possible rheumatological disease were unremarkable as well as infectious evaluation for HIV, Lyme disease, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A PET/CT scan revealed no FDG-avid focus in any area.\nSince decreased pericardial fluid volume was noted on the fourth and fifth hospital days, the pericardial drain was removed. Two days later, he became progressively dyspneic with repeat chest X-ray showing bilateral pleural effusions, cardiomegaly, and diffuses pulmonary edema.\nA radionuclide SPECT scan was then performed following injection of 5.11 mCi 99mTechnetium-labeled, macroaggregated albumin (MAA) into the peritoneal cavity. There was essentially no delay between the infusion of 99mTc-MAA and imaging. Although dynamic imaging was performed, the uptake in the pericardial sac was only faint at 15 min, but clearly visible at 1 h.

Laboratory findings revealed abnormal levels of: creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 25,865 IU/L (normal range 26-174), aldolase 40.3 U/L, sodium 125 mmol/L (normal range 135-146), chloride 71 mmol/L (normal range 96-107), bicarbonate 17 mmol/L (normal range 21-31), lactic acid 7.1 mmol/L (normal range 0.5-22), aspartate transaminase (AST) 878 IU/L (normal range 0-32), alanine transaminase (ALT) 312 IU/L (normal range 10-35), white blood cells 15.45 K/uL (normal 4.8-10.8). Urine analysis found large blood on dipstick and <1 red blood cell per high-powered field.\nBedside sonogram showed trace pericardial effusion and grossly preserved cardiac contractility. Magnetic resonance imaging of her neck revealed soft tissue thickening and diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of muscles. Histopathologic examination of her left bicep muscle showed strongly-positive HLA Class I immunohistochemistry without myofiber necrosis and mild-to-moderate type 2 myofiber atrophy ( and B). Antinuclear antibody titer was positive at a 1:640 dilution with a speckled pattern. Antip155/ 140 antibody was positive. The remainder of the myositis antibody comprehensive panel, extractable nuclear antigen screening (anti-ENA), and paraneoplastic autoantibody panel were negative (anti-Jo- 1, anti-SSA 52, anti-SSA 60, anti-Mi-2, anti-PL-7, anti-PL-12, anti-EJ, anti-Ku, anti-U2 sn RNP, anti-SRP, anti-OJ, anti PM/Scl complex, anti-neuronal nuclear antibody types 1, 2, and 3; anti-glial nuclear antibody, anti-PCA-1, anti-PCA2, anti- PCA-Tr, anti-Amphiphysin, anti-CRMP-5, anti-striational, anti-P/Q-type calcium channel, anti-N-type calcium channel, anti- Ach receptor binding antibody, anti-ACHr Ganglionic neuronal antibody).\nThe patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids and oral prednisone. She was then advanced to intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, resulting in a gradual decline of the CPK level to less than 1300 IU/L and improvement of her rash and erythematous plaques. During this time, she had progressive dysphagia, odynophagia, and oral thrush concerning for esophageal candidiasis. Despite treatment with oral nystatin rinses, which resolved her oral thrush, the patient continued to have worsening symptoms of dysphagia. Videoscopy revealed acutely-worsening dysphagia and CT-imaging demonstrated laryngeal edema. She was intubated to protect her airway, started on plasmapheresis, and fed through a nasogastric tube. Although the CPK level declined to less than 1000 IU/L, her edema and weakness persisted. Thereafter, the patient was transferred to hospice care and comfort measures were implemented.", "Question": "What is the patient's delta gap in mEq/L? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.", "LLM Answer": "17", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "25", "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 125.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 125.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 125.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 125.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 125.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 125.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 71.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 71.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 71.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 71.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 71.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 71.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 17.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 17.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 17.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 17.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 17.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 17.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 125.0 mEq/L - (71.0 mEq/L + 17.0 mEq/L) = 37.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 37.0 mEq/L.Plugging in 37.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 37.0 - 12 = 25.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 25.0 mEq/L.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

He is a nonsmoker and is receiving treatment for hypertension. He has a BP of 139/85 mmHg, TC = 201 mg/dL, LDL-C = 119 mg/dL, HDL-C = 50.1 mg/dL, TGs = 150 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) = 4.2 mg/L. The patient is very health conscious, has a good routine level of physical activity, and had his CRP level measured, at his own request, following media coverage of the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study []\u2014the measurement was done only once at an off-site laboratory. His serum LDL-C level is reported to be relatively low. He is currently treated with aspirin 81 mg/d, lisinopril 20 mg/d, and a thiazide diuretic 25 mg/d. The findings of the ASCOT Blood Pressure Lowering Arm (ASCOT-BPLA) highlighted the importance of BP control in reducing CV risk []. In that study, many patients remained hypertensive despite receiving antihypertensive therapy prior to enrolment. Since this patient remains hypertensive with his current treatment regimen, the dose of lisinopril should be increased to 40 mg/d. In addition, the lipid-lowering arm of the ASCOT trial (ASCOT-LLA), in which hypertensive patients with a fasting LDL-C of \u2264251 mg/dL were randomly assigned to treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo, showed a significant reduction in the risk of CV events with atorvastatin therapy []. Similar results were also obtained in a post hoc analysis of the ASCOT-LLA which showed that atorvastatin 10 mg significantly reduced the risk of CV events in patients 65 years of age or older []. Given the Framingham risk score of this patient, current guidelines and clinical trial evidence would support treating to an optional LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL. As this corresponds to a 16% reduction in LDL-C, various lipid-lowering options are available (). The results of the JUPITER trial further confirmed the benefit of lipid-lowering in moderately high-risk initially healthy patients and supported the need to treat such patients even more intensively. Compared with placebo, rosuvastatin 20 mg/d led to a 43% reduction in the risk of major CV events in patients with LDL-C <130 mg/dL and persistently elevated CRP (>2.0 mg/dL) []. There was no difference in the benefit for patients aged <65 or \u226565 years. Although the patient in this case study is comparable to subjects enrolled in the JUPITER study, elevated CRP was only documented in a single measurement. Since CRP is an acute phase reactant and its concentration increases rapidly in response to inflammation, the finding could easily be explained by a variety of factors, including simple infection. It would be necessary to assess CRP based on the average of two independent measurements, as was done in the JUPITER trial. Nevertheless, while the results of the JUPITER trial are provocative, they have not been incorporated into guidelines. The relevance of CRP levels is also currently under consideration and it remains to be seen whether this parameter will be included in future guidelines. This patient should therefore receive treatment based on current recommendations [], to achieve the optional LDL-C goal of <100 mg/dL with an appropriate dose of statin. Importantly, the rule of sixes should be taken into account (the greatest lipid-lowering response is obtained at the initial statin dose, while incremental doubling of the dose leads to an approximately 6% additive reduction in LDL-C) and an appropriate starting dose used to achieve this target without a requirement for subsequent dose increase. However, if the LDL-C goal is not achieved after 6 to 8 weeks, the statin regimen should be changed accordingly.", "Question": "Based on the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease, what is the likelihood of 10-year risk of MI or death for this patient?
