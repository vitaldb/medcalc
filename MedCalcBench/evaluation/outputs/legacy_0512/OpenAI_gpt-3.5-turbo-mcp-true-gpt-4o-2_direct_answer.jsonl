He was an ex-smoker of 14 years and had a low alcohol intake (14 units/week). No history of stroke or any prior hemorrhagic events. The patient\u2019s mother and younger brother both had a clinical diagnosis of ADPKD. The mother had advanced to ESRD by the age of 61, while the brother (aged 40) had not yet reached ESRD. Due to the patient\u2019s family history of ADPKD, the patient had undergone renal USS screening at age 14, whereupon polycystic kidneys consistent with a diagnosis of ADPKD were detected.\nThe patient presented with several comorbidities, including hypertension, which had been diagnosed at the age of 26 and was being controlled well using irbesartan. At the age of 15, the patient experienced an episode of severe flank pain associated with macrohaematuria. The patient\u2019s extrarenal manifestations of ADPKD included sigmoid diverticulosis and a small intracranial aneurysm, which was managed conservatively. Echocardiography also revealed a concentric myocardial hypertrophy but without signs of valvular dysfunction.\nThe patient\u2019s renal function showed an eGFR [CKD Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)] of 41 mL/min/1.73 m2, with a documented decline from 58 mL/min/1.73 m2 2.5 years previous [eight creatinine values in between documenting the slope; (CKD-3b)]. Genetic testing had not been performed, hence a PROPKD score could not be calculated. A recent MRI had documented large kidneys with a htTKV of 1692 mL/m, putting the patient into Mayo class 1E. INR is within normal limits. \nThe family history of ADPKD and the patient\u2019s early onset of hypertension and urological complications, together with their documented CKD-3b disease and Mayo class 1E at age 38, put the patient at a high likelihood for rapid disease progression. Based on the fact that few patients in CKD stage 3b had been enrolled in TEMPO 3:4, the ERA-EDTA Working Groups on Inherited Kidney Disorders and European Renal Best Practice position statement suggests that only patients up to CKD stage 3a should be commenced on tolvaptan []. This fact and its implications were discussed with the patient. However, taking into account that he had just reached this threshold, as well as his young age, a decision was made to start treatment with tolvaptan, following counselling regarding possible impact on his work as a manager of a large company.

He received hospital treatment and underwent several health examinations; however, no specific findings were observed. The symptoms were dizziness, fatigue, asthenia, irritability, elevated blood pressure (above systolic 160 mmHg), palpitation, eyestrain, and tinnitus, which aggravated with time.\nThe patient had an unremarkable medical history and was a current smoker (0.7 pack/day for 15 years). He consumed 700 mL of beer once a week. The patient had worked for 13 months in a newly constructed indoor firing range. He performed general management of the indoor firing range. His work included setting the firing range (preparing the bullets and targets) before the firing exercises, and cleaning and handling the disposed warheads after the firing exercises. There was much gray-black dust during the cleaning process; however, he did not wear any special protective equipment.\nHis BLL was measured owing to suspicion of heavy metal poisoning; 0.1 mL of whole blood was diluted with 0.8 mL 1%Triton\u2122 X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and analyzed for BLL using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (novAA 400p;Analytik Jena AG, Jena, Germany). The BLL was estimated at 64 \u00b5g/dL; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with lead poisoning and immediately withdrawn from his work to avoid further lead exposure. The standard for elevated BLL among adults is 10 \u00b5g/dL, as determined by the Adult Blood Lead Epidemiology & Surveillance from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) (). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)'s occupational exposure limit for BLL is 40 \u00b5g/dL (). Korean blood-lead criteria for the diagnosis of lead poisoning in workers is 40 \u03bcg/dL (). The patient was immediately admitted to the military hospital and investigated thoroughly. His examination revealed elevated blood pressure (150/110 mmHg), and the peripheral blood smear showed poikilocytosis. The liver function test, renal function test, complete blood count, and differential count were within normal ranges. His urine tested negative for microproteinuria. According to the examination by the neurologist, there were no significant findings in the electromyography, nerve conduction velocity, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and neurologic tests. The hearing test indicated mild hearing loss (hearing threshold: right/left = 35/35 dB) at 4 kHz, and he was diagnosed with dry eye by the ophthalmologist; he received treatments from the respective departments.\nThe treatment for lead poisoning included avoidance of the harmful factor (prohibition of work) for 3 weeks following which he underwent BLL measurement. The BLL was 39 \u00b5g/dL and the blood zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) level was 45.1 \u00b5g/dL (reference range: 10\u201338 \u00b5g/dL). He showed no improvement of symptoms; hence, for an intensive BLL decrease chelation treatment was administered. For the chelation treatment, 1 gram of calcium-disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaNa2 EDTA) was mixed with 250 mL of 5% dextrose (JW Life Science Corp, Seoul, Korea) in water and was administered intravenously over 6 hours. The chelation treatment was given for 5 days, and the renal functions and liver functions were assessed daily. He completed 5 days of chelation treatment with no adverse effects. He was discharged after his blood pressure normalized (130/85 mmHg) and the subjective symptoms improved. Three weeks after the discharge (7 weeks after lead exposure avoidance), the BLL was 9.7 \u00b5g/dL ().\nAs evident from the workplace environmental monitoring (April 2 to April 15, 2014), the exposure in the air was an 8hours, time-weighted average of 0.015\u20130.387 mg/m3, which exceeded the acceptable standards (0.05 mg/m3) () ().

The symptoms started a month prior for which she visited her primary medical doctor and was treated for pneumonia. Her symptoms continued to persist and gradually worsen at which point she was also treated with tamiflu for influenza. Her other symptoms however continued to progress and consisted of fever, chills, cough, body aches, and shortness of breath. The patient is a non-smoker, drinks alcohol socially, and works in a pharmacy.\nOn physical examination, the patient was tachycardia with a heart rate of 118, blood pressure of 111/72, respiratory rate of 24, and was saturating 88% on room air. At the time, she was afebrile with a temperature of 99.1 \u00b0F. Significant findings on examination showed diffuse rhonchi bilaterally with crackles on lung examination. Laboratory data demonstrated hemoglobin of 13, hematocrit of 39, white blood cell of 10.9, and platelets of 344,000. Sodium was 136 mEq/L, potassium 3.8 mEq/L, chloride 98 mEq/L, bicarbonate 21 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL, creatinine 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose of 113 mg/dL. Troponins were negative. D-dimer was elevated at 0.71 and CT angiogram (CTA) was conducted to rule out pulmonary embolism. CTA of the chest was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed tree-in bud changes in the right upper lobe suspicious for an infectious or inflammatory process (). Similar findings were also seen in the right lower lobe. There were linear changes in the lower lobes bilaterally which most likely represented atelectasis and there was a 7.6 mm nodule in the left lower lobe.\nThe patient was admitted to telemetry for the management of pneumonia with azithromycin and ceftriaxone initially. Patient was found to be positive for Mycoplasma pneumonia and medications were adjusted accordingly. Patient continued to have persistent hypoxia and continued to desaturate to 88% upon ambulation. She was later found to have hemophilus influenza growth in sputum culture, which was properly being managed by her antibiotic regimen. During her hospital stay, although the patient was receiving solumedrol and antibiotics she continued to have diffuse bilateral crackles and productive cough. Patient was found to have leukocytosis as high as 19.6, but this could be attributed to her steroid treatment. However, this train of thought remained unclear as the patient was also found to have a bandemia of 21. Her antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were adjusted to consist of doxycycline, zyvox, and fluconazole. The patient continued to deteriorate and systemic workup including allergy test, antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (cANCA), perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), purified protein derivative (PPD), QuantiFERON, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test was all conducted. Full systemic workup returned negative for any findings. After completing her course of antibiotics, she was also removed from her steroids but would continue to desaturate and lung findings remained unchanged. Patient underwent bronchoscopy but no significant mass or lesion was found to biopsy and her postoperative diagnosis remained as non-resolving pneumonia. Repeat CT scan was performed which showed minimal improvement and continue to suggest pneumonia and possibly underlying interstitial lung disease ().\nThe patient was scheduled for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) procedure with biopsy of the right middle and lower lobes. Right lower lobe wedge biopsy on pathology showed lung parenchyma with consolidation, atelectasis, and areas of fibrosis (). Right mid lung biopsy also showed foci of consolidation but also consisted of varying stages of questionable emphysema (). As the findings were highly unusual and emphysematous changes were not found on patient\u2019s CT scans, the pathology was sent to a specialist, who confirmed the results but again noted them to be very non-specific. The patient\u2019s post-operative status was complicated and patient desaturated overnight and required intubation. Alpha-1 antitrypsin was sent but returned elevated. The patient was successfully extubated after 2 days. She was placed back on steroids and was clinically improving over the course of another 1 week. Her pulse oximetry however on room air remained around 86% even after a week of steroids and thus the patient would be discharged on home oxygen therapy. Pulmonary function tests were significant for a forced vital capacity (FVC) moderately reduced at 1.65 L (60%), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) severely reduced at 0.98 L (40%), FEV1/FVC ratio reduced at 59%, and MVV severely reduced at 28%. Flow volume loop demonstrated a combined obstructive and restrictive contour (). Lung volumes showed a vital capacity reduced at 1.65 L (60%), total lung capacity (TLC) reduced at 2.08 L (56%), and residual volume (RV) reduced at 0.43 L (43%). Her diffusion capacity (DLCO) was also severely reduced at 38%. These findings were suggestive of combined severe, irreversible obstructive and restrictive lung disease with severely reduced diffusion capacity.

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mEq. To convert from 136.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 136.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 136.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 136.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 136.0 mmol sodium/L. \nThe concentration of bun is 15.0 mg/dL. \nThe concentration of glucose is 113.0 mg/dL. \nPlugging these values into the equation, we get 2 * 136.0 + (15.0 / 2.8) + (15.0 / 18) = 283.63492 mmol/L.The patient's calculated serum osmolality concentration is 283.63492 mmol/L.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 138.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 104.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 104.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 104.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 104.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 104.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 104.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 7.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 7.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 7.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 7.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 7.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 7.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 7.0 mEq/L) = 27.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 27.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 2.4 g/dL.

The patient's BUN is greater than or equal to 30 mg/dL, and so we add 20 points to the score, making current total 110.0 + 20 = 130.0.\nThe concentration of sodium is 123.0 mmol/L. The patient's sodium is less than 130 mmol/L, and so we add 20 points to the score, making the current total 130.0 + 20 = 150.0.\nThe concentration of glucose is 15.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 15.0 mmol. To convert 15.0 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 15.0 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.015 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.015 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 2.702 g glucose. To convert 2.702 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 2.702 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 2702.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 2702.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 270.2 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 15.0 mmol glucose/L converts to 270.2 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is greater than 250 mg/dL, and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 150.0 + 10 = 160.0.\nThe patient's hematocrit is 35.0 %. The patient's hematocrit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 160.0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 67.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 160.0.\nThe patient's PSI score is 160.0.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed.

She brought her abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan taken in another hospital showing a 10\u00d76.3\u00d78.6 cm-sized left adrenal mass with hemorrhagic necrosis (). On admission, her systolic blood pressure was 150 to 170 mm Hg and her diastolic blood pressure was 100 to 110 mm Hg, higher than the standard values for her age. She had no previous history of hypertension. Her weight was 63 kg, and her height was 175 cm. The routine biochemical study, random urine analysis, and blood coagulation test results were all normal, and the serum electrolytes showed Na 141 mmol/L (normal range [NR], 135 to 145), K 3.3 mmol/L (NR, 3.5 to 5.5), and Cl 100 mmol/L (NR, 98 to 120). Hormone tests showed cortisol was reduced to 0.9 \u00b5g/dL (NR, 6.7 to 22.6) and ACTH was elevated slightly, to 75.94 pg/mL (NR, 7.2 to 63.6). Renin was reduced to 0.80 ng/mL/hr (NR, 1.31 to 3.95) and aldosterone was elevated to 183.31 pg/mL (NR, 29.9 to 158.8). The aldosterone renin ratio was 22.9. Chest X-ray and electrocardiography were normal. The results of 24-hour urine analysis were as follows: metanephrine 0.518 mg/day (NR, 0 to 1.3), epinephrine 2.3 \u00b5g/day (NR, 0 to 20), and vanillylmandelic acid 4.04 mg/day (NR, 0 to 8); all values were within the NR except those for 17-ketosteroids 2.77 mg/day (NR, 7 to 20) and urinary free cortisol 37.6 (NR, 55.5 to 286). Typical CT findings of a large adrenal mass with hemorrhagic necrosis led to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma with biochemically burnt-out status.\nTo further evaluate the characteristics of the adrenal mass, metaiodobenzylguanidine-single-photon emission computed tomography (MIBG-SPECT) imaging was performed and showed no significant radiotracer uptake. Next, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-CT (18F-FDG PET-CT) was performed, and the FDG uptake in the solid portion of the mass was elevated (). On CT scan, the contralateral right adrenal gland appeared relatively normal. The possibility of pheochromocytoma could not be excluded based on MIBG-negative and PET-positive findings. Thus, after proper premedication, the mass was surgically removed due its size. After laparoscopic adrenalectomy, a left hemorrhagic adrenal mass was pathologically confirmed as adrenal cortical adenoma 10\u00d75\u00d73 cm in size (). The patient complained of nausea and generalized weakness after the left adrenalectomy. Moreover, blood pressure remained at 190/119 mm Hg. After the operation, her ACTH was elevated to 406.9 pg/mL (NR, 7.2 to 63.6), and the low-dose ACTH stimulation test showed her cortisol was 1.0 \u00b5g/dL (NR, 6.7 to 22.6) at baseline, 1.6 \u00b5g/dL after 30 minutes, and 1.0 \u00b5g/dL after 1 hour showing blunted response. After reviewing her abdominal CT, we discovered that she had received plastic surgery on both breasts. We requested the patient regarding her medical history as she had failed to mention this procedure on the first visit. The patient had artificial prostheses inserted because she never developed breasts during puberty. She also lacked secondary sexual characteristics such as pubic and axillary hair (Tanner stage I). The patient confessed she experienced no menarche in puberty and had kept these facts secret even from her family members. Further hormone testing showed the followings: thyroid stimulating hormone 3.1 \u00b5IU/mL (NR, 0.4 to 4.9), prolactin 27.2 ng/mL (NR, 3.3 to 26.7), luteininzing hormone 25.0 mIU/mL (NR, 1.2 to 10.9), follicular stimulating hormone 51.5 mIU/mL (NR, 1.8 to 8.8), estradiol <20 pg/mL (NR, 27 to 433), progesterone 4.32 ng/mL (NR, 0.2 to 23), and 17-OH-progesterone 0.21 ng/mL (NR, 0.1 to 5.0). However, both dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and renin were reduced to 0.41 \u00b5g/mL (NR, 1.3 to 9.8) and 0.7 ng/mL/hr (NR, 1.3 to 3.9), respectively, whereas aldosterone was elevated to 171.9 pg/mL (NR, 29.9 to 158.8) (). Furthermore, X-ray examination of the upper arm showed that the bone age was compatible with that of a 15-year-old female and bone mineral density was below the expected range for her actual age (Z-score -3.1 in the lumbar spine and Z-score -3.4 in the femoral neck), probably due to sex hormone deficiency. Chromosomal study of the patient was performed using peripheral blood leukocytes and showed a normal karyotype of 46, XX, female. We also conducted polymerase chain reaction for all intron sequences in the neighborhood of the CYP17A1 gene using appropriate primers. According to mutation analysis, we found a compound heterozygous mutation for p. Tyr329fs (c.985_987delTACinsAA) and missense mutation p. His373Leu (c.1118A>T) in exon 6. She was diagnosed with CAH caused by 17\u03b1-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency confirmed by the CYP17A1 gene mutation, presenting with lack of secondary sexual development, reduced production of cortisol and DHEA, increased aldosterone and ACTH as well as atypical huge adrenal mass. The patient was started on oral prednisolone, 7.5 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon, combined with estrogen. Finally, general weakness improved significantly, and the dose of oral prednisolone was reduced to 5 mg in the morning and 2.5 mg in the afternoon. To date, her hormone level has been monitored for 3 years. Due to her poor compliance and concerns of weight gain (although only 5 mg of prednisolone was prescribed), ACTH remained high.

The aneurysm had increased from 60 to 76 mm in 3 months before the operation and some blood flow was observed inside the aneurysm. The entry to the aneurysm was identified at the anastomosis with artificial blood vessels above the aortic valve. Blood flow showed a to-and-fro pattern between the left ventricle and the aneurysm. The blood flow from the aneurysm to the left ventricle during diastole was similar to aortic regurgitation (AR), and the degree of regurgitation was moderate to severe. Furthermore, we also found abnormal blood flow from the aneurysm to the main pulmonary artery. Other preoperative transthoracic echocardiography findings included normal systolic function, grade II diastolic function (E/A: pseudo-normalization pattern), mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Three months before the operation, he developed heart failure due to perivascular abscess. His preoperative chest X-ray revealed cardiac dilatation (CTR 60%) and bilateral pleural effusion. The electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia and complete right bundle branch block. Routine laboratory data were within normal range except hemoglobin 10.4 g dL\u22121, platelet 281,000 \u03bcL\u22121, fibrinogen 460 mg dL\u22121, WBC 6200 \u03bcL\u22121, CRP 6.78 mg dL\u22121, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) 1860 pg dL\u22121, and creatinine 1.25 mg dL\u22121. Coronary computed tomography showed no findings suggesting coronary stenosis. Thoracic computed tomography demonstrated the following: extensive adhesion between the aneurysm and the sternum, and angiectopia of the right subclavian artery originating from the distal aortic arch (Fig. ).\nWe discussed intraoperative management of the present case at a preoperative conference of anesthesiologists and cardiac surgeons and determined the following algorithm: (1) A left anterolateral small thoracotomy is performed and a left ventricle venting tube is placed to avoid left ventricle distension, because the patient has severe aortic regurgitation. (2) Nifekalant is administered slowly to prevent VF associated with cooling. (3) Institution of full-flow cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is done through the femoral vessels or combination of the right axial artery and femoral vessels. (4) Once CPB is established, cooling is initiated by monitoring the bladder temperature and the patient is cooled to 27 \u00b0C. (5) At the target bladder temperature of 27 \u00b0C, resternotomy is performed. (6) The temperature is maintained until the complete division of the sternum to prevent VF and to conserve contractility. (7) After completing dissection of retrosternal adhesions, aortic cross-clamping is performed, the pseudoaneurysm was incised, and cardioplegia was delivered selectively in the coronary ostia.\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with midazolam 5 mg, fentanyl 0.2 mg, and vecuronium 8 mg and maintained with sevoflurane, propofol, remifentanil, and vecuronium. The trachea was intubated with a 37-Fr left double-lumen tube for one-lung ventilation. A percutaneous DC pad was attached on his chest prophylactically. After induction of anesthesia, the left radial and femoral arteries were cannulated for arterial blood pressure monitoring. A central venous catheter and a pulmonary artery catheter were placed through the right internal jugular vein. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe was inserted for intraoperative cardiac monitoring. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was measured with near-infrared spectroscopy. We detected the oxygen step-up in the pulmonary artery and calculated that pulmonary flow/systemic flow (Qp/Qs) was 1.7.\nAt first, we administered nifekalant, 10 mg, intravenously. Then, the vent tube was inserted into the left ventricle with a small left thoracotomy under one-lung ventilation. Extracorporeal circulation was established through the cannulation from the right femoral artery and vein, which provided full-flow CPB. Then, cooling was initiated by monitoring the bladder temperature. Resternotomy was initiated after the patient was cooled to 27 \u00b0C. The strong adhesion between the sternum and the aortic artery was completely exfoliated without damaging the pseudoaneurysm. Severe bradycardia, QT prolongation, and premature ventricular contraction (PVC) were observed, but VF did not occur under 27 \u00b0C (Fig. ). Bilateral rSO2 decreased with progression of bradycardia (left rSO2 54 to 36% and right rSO2 51 to 35%). Although we increased the blood flow of CPB and transfused red blood cell, the values remained low in 30s. The values continued to be 30s until the aortic clamping and after then improved to 40s. After exposure of the aortic clamp site was completed, we re-started cooling and clamped the aorta at the distal side of the aneurysm and induced asystole by selective cardioplegia. The Bentall operation scheduled was performed without any problem. Weaning from CPB was uneventful and the patient was transported to ICU without extubation.

This means that the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO\u2082 ratio is 166.667. The patient is reported to not be on mechanical ventillation. The patient is reported to not be using continuous positive airway pressure. Because the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO\u2082 ratio is less than 200, the patient is not on mechanical ventillation and is not using continious positive airway pressure, we increase the score by two points, making the current total 0 + 2 = 2.\nFor three points to be given, the patient must be taking more than 5 micrograms/kg/min, less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/kg/min of epinephrine, or less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/kg/min of norepinephrine. Because at least one of these cases is true for the patient, we increment the score by three points, making the current total 2 + 3 = 5.\nThe patient's glasgow coma score is not reported so we take it to be 15. Because the patient's glasgow coma score is 15, we add 0 points to the score, keeping the score at 5.\n The concentration of bilirubin is 1.8 mg/dL. Because the patient's bilirubin concentration is at least 1.2 mg/dL, but less than 2.0 mg/dL, we increment the score by one point, make the current score 5 + 1 = 6.\nThe patient's concentration of platelet is 180000.0 count/\u00b5L. Because the patient's platelet count is at least 150*10\u00b3/\u00b5L, we do not any points to the score, keeping the current score at 6.\nThe concentration of creatinine is 120.0 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of creatinine is 120.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 120.0 \u00b5mol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 120.0 \u00b5mol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.00012 mol creatinine. To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00012 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.014 g creatinine. To convert 0.014 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.014 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 14.0 mg creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 14.0 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.4 mg creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 120.0 \u00b5mol creatinine/L converts to 1.4 mg creatinine/dL. The patients urine output is 600 mL/day.\n\nBecause the patient's creatinine concentration is at least 1.2 mg/dL, but less than 2.0 mg/dL, we increment the score by one point, making the current total 6 + 1 = 7.\nHence, the patient's SOFA score is 7 points.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

The following histopathological data were gathered: The glomeruli showed no conspicuous changes, mild to moderate atrophy with mononuclear inflammatory cells and occasional eosinophilic infiltration of interstitium, some tubules contained marked Ox crystals, and some contained granular and white blood cells casts. Following the acute rejection, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) was administered for the patient. After few days of ATG administration, the drug was discontinued because of fever. The possibility of PH1 was considered when a lot of Ox crystals were observed in the renal allograft biopsy and also by ruling out the other causes of hyperoxaluria. Therefore, pyridoxine therapy was commenced (dose, interval, and route of admin).\nIn January 2009, the patient's serum Cr and BUN levels were 4.8 and 38 mg/dl, respectively. The patient's computed tomography (CT) scan and radiography demonstrated cardiomegaly, bilateral pleural effusion with congestion, and calcification at the right pulmonary hilum and parenchyma.

He had no history of cough, ear discharge, respiratory infection, dysuria, diarrhea, gastrointestinal distress or vomiting.\nHis past history included surgery for a brain abscess at the age of 13, Fontan surgery at the age of 13, ocular surgery for retinal detachment at the age of 16, and multiple small skin abscesses chiefly on his left foot, which recurred after treatment and led to an excision of an abscess on his foot. At the age of 20, he was diagnosed with protein-losing enteropathy.\nThe last echocardiography performed before his hospitalization showed a right to left flow in the Fontan circuit, signifying a flow of de-oxygenated blood from the intended pulmonic to the systemic circulation.\nOn physical examination, he was found to be febrile with a temperature of 39\u00b0C on admission, a heart rate of 88 per minute, a respiratory rate of 26 per minute, blood pressure of 98/60 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 89 percent in room air. A head to toe examination identified clubbing of his nails, a median sternotomy scar, mild abdominal distension and pedal edema. His teeth and oral cavity were found to be normal. He was 174 cm tall and weighed 51 kg.\nHis laboratory data on admission showed the following: white blood cells (WBCs) 14,000/mm3, neutrophils 84.5 percent, lymphocytes 8.3 percent, eosinophils 0.2 percent, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 45 mm/hour, hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL, urea 19 mg/dL, serum creatinine 0.6 mg/dL, sodium 122 mmol/L, potassium 3.7 mmol/L, total protein 3.7 g/dL, serum albumin 1.3 g/dL and serum globulin 2.4 g/dL. He tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus. A further work-up for immune deficiency could not be performed for logistical reasons. A urine analysis showed 20-25 red blood cells and 10-12 WBCs per high-power field.\nA 2 D echocardiography revealed no vegetations. An ultrasound scan revealed a mass in his left kidney measuring 7.2 \u00d7 4 cm. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a hypodense area in the lower pole of his left kidney measuring 5.28 \u00d7 6.22 cm, consistent with a renal abscess, which was percutaneously aspirated and grew highly sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Special staining for acid-fast bacilli was negative. Figure shows the CT images. His blood cultures were repeatedly negative. One of the urine cultures grew Escherichia coli and Enterococcus species. The E. coli was sensitive to amikacin, cefoperazone and/or sulbactam, gentamicin, imipenem, meropenem, natamycin, nitrofurantoin, and piperacillin and/or tazobactam. The Enterococcus species was sensitive to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, gentamicin, imipenem, linezolid, meropenem and nitrofurantoin.\nOn the basis of the sensitivity of the S. aureus isolated from the abscess, he was treated with intravenous gentamicin, 80 mg at eight-hourly intervals, and with intravenous teicoplanin, 400 mg once per day.\nHe continued experiencing spikes of high-grade fever, and a repeat ultrasound after 12 days of appropriate therapy showed only minimal resolution of the lesion. Surgery was anticipated. A technetium-99 m renogram was performed to see the split function of the kidney with the abscess and to determine whether or not a partial nephrectomy could be performed. The renogram revealed a total glomerular filtration rate of 94 mL/min, with the left kidney contributing 36 mL/min and the right kidney 58 mL/min, and no evidence of obstruction. Figure shows the results of the technetium-99 m renogram.\nIn view of the persistence of the abscess, he underwent a surgical exploration of the renal bed. An attempt was made to carry out a partial nephrectomy of the affected region. However, this failed and so a left nephrectomy was performed. Figure shows the nephrectomy specimen.

At the time of his discharge, his serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL.\nA histopathological examination of the diseased kidney revealed infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells and histiocytes. The replacement of renal parenchymal tissue by sheets of foamy histiocytes admixed with neutrophils was observed and this was consistent with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. A special stain for acid-fast bacilli was negative. Clinical, radiological and histopathological examinations failed to provide any evidence of an obstructive lesion in his urinary tract or of renal calculi.\nTwo weeks after his discharge from hospital, he complained of fever. A CT scan of his abdomen was performed and a residual renal bed abscess was found. A pigtail catheter was inserted and daily aspiration and antibiotic instillation were performed. A week later he was discharged again, with oral antibiotics.\nAbout seven months after the surgery, he remained in a perfect state of health without reports of further infection.

Transthoracic echocardiography findings were within the normal range. Exercise cardiac stress test showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia. No secondary cause of HTN could be elicited, and the patient was diagnosed with primary essential HTN. He was placed on three anti-hypertensive drugs: amlodipine 10 mg daily, carvedilol 25 mg two times a day, and hydralazine three times a day. He had stopped taking his blood pressure (BP) medication about one year ago due to insurance issues.\nHe reported consumption of two beers a week but denied smoking and recreational drug abuse.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol.

He was found to have new onset hypertension and an abnormal urinalysis.\nOn physical examination temperature was 98.6, pulse was 64 beat per minute and blood pressure was 208/104 mmHg. Fundoscopic exam was normal. Jugular veins were distended. Heart examination showed a displaced apical impulse. Breath sounds were decreased on the right side of the chest. The abdomen was remarkable for marked splenomegaly and shifting dullness. There was marked pretibial edema. No peripheral lymphadenopathy was detected.\nInitial laboratory evaluation showed a white blood cell count of 7.2 \u00d7109/L, hematocrit 34%, and platelet count 99 \u00d7 109/L. The serum creatinine was 2.9 mg/dl, and blood urea nitrogen was 37 mg/dl. Serum electrolytes were (in meq/l) sodium 143, potassium 4.3, chloride 112, and bicarbonate 22. Hepatic transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin time were normal. Total protein was 4.8 g/dl and albumin 2.6 g/dl. Urinalysis showed 3+ blood, 3+ protein with abundant granular casts and RBCS but no cellular casts. 24 hour urinary protein excretion was 28 g. Serum immunofixation electrophoresis, SPEP and UPEP were negative for monoclonal bands. Serum complement (C3) was 72.3 mg/dl (83-193) and C4 was 22.8 mg/dl (12-36). Rheumatoid factor was 299 IU (0-29). Tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, RPR, human immunodeficiency virus antibodies, streptozyme, and antinuclear antibodies were negative.\nChest radiographic study showed a right pleural effusion and a normal sized heart. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed hepatosplenomegaly and periaortic lymphadenopathy. Doppler ultrasonography of the kidneys was normal.\nA percutaneous renal biopsy was performed. Light microscopy showed increased cellularity in all glomeruli and accentuation of lobular architecture. Silver staining showed double contours within the capillary loops. Epithelial crescents were not present. Immunofluorescence studies showed granular staining in a lobular pattern for IgG, IgM, Kappa, and lambda. Electron microscopy showed subendothelial and mesangial fine electron dense deposits (Figure ). These histologic changes were consistent with MPGN, type 1. There was no evidence of lymphomatous infiltration and there was no histological evidence of cyroglobulin deposition or amyloidosis.\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy showed a hypercellular bone marrow (80%) with extensive infiltration of small B cell lymphoctyes. The B cells were positive for the B cell marker CD20 and negative for T cell markers CD5 and CD3. The final diagnosis was low grade B cell NHL.\nAfter initial treatment with six cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone. The patient improved symptomatically and his blood pressure normalized. Serum creatinine, which initially peaked at 7.1 mg/dl, decreased dramatically to a baseline level of 1.4 - 1.7 mg/dl. Urine protein excretion decreased to <300 mg/24hr. Microscopic hematuria resolved. Serum albumin increased to 3.5-4.0 g/dl with resolution of the proteinuria. The anemia and thrombocytopenia resolved. Repeated computed tomography of the abdomen at intervals of six and 12 months showed improvement in splenomegaly and periaortic lymphadenopathy. A repeat bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence for NHL. During long term follow up, the patient has had two relapses of NHL confirmed by bone marrow biopsies. The first relapse was treated with six cycles of fludarabine and mitoxantrone and the second with rituximab. Subsequent bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence for lymphoma, and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed resolution of lymphadenopathy with interval improvement in splenomegaly. In each relapse there was a transient increase in the serum creatinine concentration, up to 2 mg/dl, that was attributed to factors other than MPGN. Urinalysis remained normal.
