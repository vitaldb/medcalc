This means that the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO\u2082 ratio is 1.451. The patient is reported to be on mechanical ventillation. Whether the patient is on continuous positive airway pressure is not reported and so we assume this to be false. Because the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO\u2082 ratio is less than 100, and the patient is using at least one of (i) mechanical ventillation or (ii) continious positive airway pressure, we increase the score by four points, makeing the current total 0 + 4 = 4.\r\nFor two points to be given, the patient must be taking less than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/min or any amount of dobutamine. Because at least one of these cases is true for the patient, we increment the score by two points, making the current total 4 + 2 = 6.\r\nThe patient's glasgow coma score is not reported so we take it to be 15. Because the patient's glasgow coma score is between 10 and 12, we add 2 points to the score, making the current score 6 + 2 = 8.\r\n The concentration of bilirubin is 1.9 mg/dL. Because the patient's bilirubin concentration is at least 1.2 mg/dL but less than 2.0 mg/dL, we increment the score by one point, make the current score 8 + 1 = 9.\r\nThe patient's concentration of platelet is 165000.0 count/\u00b5L. Because the patient's platelet count is at least 150*10\u00b3/\u00b5L, we do not any points to the score, keeping the current score at 9.\r\nHence, the patient's SOFA score is 9 points.", "Result": "Correct"}

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mg to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mg. To convert from 137.0 mg to mEq, first convert from mg to mmol.To convert 137.0 mg of sodium to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 137.0 mg sodium * 0.001 g/mg = 0.137 g sodium. To convert from grams of sodium to moles, divide by the molar mass 22.99 g/mol, which will give 0.137 g/(22.99 g sodium/mol) = 0.006 mol sodium. To convert 0.006 mol of sodium to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.006 mol sodium * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 6.0 mmol sodium. To convert from 6.0 mmol sodium to mEq, multiply the mmol amount by the valence, to get 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq sodium. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mEq/L. This will result to 6.0 mEq sodium/0.1 L = 60.0 mEq sodium/L. The concentration value of 137.0 mg sodium/dL converts to 60.0 mEq sodium/L. \r\nThe concentration of chloride is 95.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 95.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 95.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 95.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 95.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 95.0 mEq chloride/L. \r\nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 30.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 30.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 30.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 30.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 30.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 30.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \r\nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 60.0 mEq/L - (95.0 mEq/L + 30.0 mEq/L) = -65.0 mEq/L.

Laboratory results showing hyperglycemia (glucose, 500 mg/dL) and ketonuria strongly indicated DKA. The patient was transferred to our emergency unit because of worsening mental status despite initiation of therapy with intravenous fluid and shortacting insulin. The patient's medical history was unremarkable (her mother had type 2 diabetes mellitus). On admission, the patient was lethargic, severely dehydrated, and drowsy (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS, eye-verbal-motor]=14 [--]). Vital signs indicated tachycardia (124 beats/min), tachypnea (40 breaths/min), and hypothermia (35\u2103). Blood pressure was in the normal range (106/56 mmHg), body weight had decreased by 1.7 kg in the previous month to 48 kg (25th\u201350th percentile), and body mass index was 20 kg/m2 (50th\u201375th percentile). Chest and abdominal x-rays showed no specific abnormalities. Initial venous blood gas analysis indicated metabolic acidosis (pH, 6.92; PCO2, 27 mmHg; PO2, 57 mmHg; HCO3, 5.6 mmol/L). Serum chemistry and electrolyte tests revealed 569 mg/dL glucose, 133 mmol/L corrected sodium, 3.2 mmol/L potassium, 8.5 mg/dL corrected calcium, 2.1 mg/dL phosphate, 25.9 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 0.57 mg/dL creatinine, and 0.6 mmol/L lactate.

Phosphate replacement was increased to achieve a 3.8 mEq/kg/day phosphorus rate. A repeat brain CT imaging study showed no specific findings. The patient's electrolyte and pH values began normalizing within 2 days but mechanical ventilation was still required because hypophosphatemia was not alleviated (phosphate, 1.4 mg/dL).

She had off and on constitutional symptoms of disease such as general malaise, myalgia, polyarthralgia (mainly involved knee, elbow, and ankle joints), anorexia, weight loss, headache, and pyrexia from the last 4 years. She also had a history of recurrent blood-stained nasal discharge, epistaxis, nasal crusting, nasal ulceration, cough, breathlessness, stridor, and wheeze from the last 3 years. She had a history of pedal edema 3 months back. She also complained of diminution of vision with redness of eyes from 3 months. The patient had a history of ulcers on lips and tongue from the past 4 days and decreased frequency of urination from 3 days. There is no history of hematuria, hemoptysis, or cardiovascular manifestations. On examination, her vitals were deranged; she had tachycardia (120/bpm) and hypotension (100/60 mm of Hg). She also had pallor and bilateral pedal edema. There was high suspicion of GPA with acute renal failure or rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis associated with systemic small-vessel vasculitis. Keeping these two main diagnoses in mind, the investigations were ordered accordingly.\r\nIt is based on a combination of clinical manifestations of systemic disease, positive ANCA serology, and histological evidence of necrotizing vasculitis, necrotizing glomerulonephritis, or granulomatous inflammation of affected organs such as skin, lung, or kidney.\r\nA trucut biopsy was taken from the right kidney of the patient and detailed analysis was done. On light microscopy, there was focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis involving more than 60% glomeruli associated with extracapillary proliferation with pauci-immune crescent formation. Electron microscopic examination showed fibrinoid deposition in the glomerular basement membrane. In biochemistry, serum sodium (159 mmol/L) and serum potassium levels (17 mmol/L) were deranged. In kidney panel, serum urea (155.8 mg/dL) and serum creatinine levels (8.9 mg/dL) were highly increased suggesting severe form of disease.\r\nOn performing ANCA serology, her serum showed a predominantly diffuse, granular cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) staining pattern on indirect immunofluorescence. By direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, there were high titers of ANCA directed against proteinase-3 (PR-3). PR-3 (1:100 with 1+ intensity) was highly raised and confirmed the diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with c-ANCA positivity.\r\nThe patient underwent two sessions of hemodialysis with a 2-day interval with packed red cell transfusion. Following that, serum urea and creatinine levels were controlled. Due to high levels of circulating c-ANCA autoantibodies, TPE was planned in addition to the standard therapy. GPA comes under category I, Grade 1A; American Society for Apheresis guidelines 2016.[] TPE sessions were started on the 4thday of admission. A total of seven cycles was performed with 1.3 total plasma volumes exchanged on every alternate day. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and normal saline were used as replacement fluids. During the third cycle of TPE after 5 units of FFP transfusion, the patient developed allergic reaction in the form of severe itching all over the body. To treat allergic reaction, oral pheniramine maleate 5 mg and injection hydrocortisone 100 mg intravenous (i.v.) were given, and after 20 min, procedure was restarted and completed successfully. Rest six cycles of TPE was done uneventfully. Simultaneously, standard induction therapy was also started that comprised of combination of cyclophosphamide (500 mg, i.v.) and methylprednisolone 1000 mg, i.v. daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisolone 60 mg daily for at least 4 weeks. Mesna 200 mg slow i.v. over 2 h was also given to prevent cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Regular monitoring of full blood count, serum proteins, renal function, liver function, urine cytology, and clinical symptoms were done. After seven cycles of TPE, the patient was improved clinically as indicated by her renal function tests and ANCA serology and hence TPE was stopped. The patient's recovery was faster due to the timely intervention of TPE along with standard immunosuppression therapy. The total hospital stay of patient was 18 days which was lesser in comparison to the patient who were treated with standard therapy alone.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 138.0 mEq sodium/L. \r\nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol.

The radiological features were consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans.\r\nHe was treated for acute exacerbation of his respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation in the PICU and received supportive therapy including bronchodilators, steroids and antibiotics. He required a prolonged hospitalization to be stabilized and could only be discharged home after 2 months.

At follow up evaluation after 4 weeks, he continued to remain hypoxemic on room air and showed mild respiratory distress even at rest.", "Question": "What is the number of SIRS critiera met by the patient?", "LLM Answer": "3", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "3", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.\r\nThe patient's temperature is 98.0 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 66.0 = 36.667 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.\r\nThe patient's heart rate is 150.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is greater than 90 beats per minute, this meets SIRS criteria and so we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\r\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 14900.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 14900.0 count/\u00b5L of white blood cell to m^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000000.0 \u00b5L/m^3 which will give 14900.0 white blood cell count/\u00b5L * 1000000000.0 \u00b5L/m^3 = 14900000000000.0 white blood cell count/m^3. Because the white blood cell count is greater than 12000 count per m^3, we increment the criteria count by 1 making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.\r\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 22.0 breaths per minute, which is greater than 20 breaths per minute. The patient's PaCO\u2082 partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg.At least one of the criteria is met, and so we increment the criteria count by 1 giving us a total of 2 + 1 = 3 criteria met.\r\nHence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 3.", "Result": "Correct"}

The patient states he has had chest discomfort and food intolerance for the past week, but that his symptoms were far worse tonight. He notes no inciting event, recent trauma, or aggravating factors. On exam he appears uncomfortable, anxious, and is in a semi-tripod position. Vitals are pertinent for a heart rate of 144, systolic blood pressure in the 180 s, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 1L O2 via nasal cannula. Of note, the patient weighed 67.2 kg, and was 173 cm tall. Chart review showed that he had lost approximately 4 kg (last recorded weight in chart was 71.2 kg), since his last medical visit.\r\nPrimary survey was overall unremarkable. Airway was secure, patient\u2019s breathing improved with 3 L oxygen, breath sounds were present and equal bilaterally, vascular access was obtained, and GCS was 15. Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient\u2019s blood pressure to systolic 140 s. Given this patient\u2019s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs). Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection.\r\nLabs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross. EKG was unremarkable. A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ).\r\nThe patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified. His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential. Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses. Labs continued to be pending. Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).\r\nAlong with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.\r\nThe findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.\r\nOn EGD, the patient\u2019s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient\u2019s lab derangements (Fig. ).\r\nThe decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\r\nThe patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.\r\nThe patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient\u2019s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning).

The patient's bmi is therefore 67.2 kg / (1.73 m * 1.73 m) = 22.453 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 22.5, indicating they are normal weight.\r\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation. Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 67.2 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 83) * 67.2 * 1) / (1.4 * 72) = 38.0 mL/min.

The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\r\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\r\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 137.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 137.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 137.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 137.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 137.0 mEq sodium/L. \r\nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \r\nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 9.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 9.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 9.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 9.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 9.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \r\nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 9.0 mEq/L) = 30.0 mEq/L.

Physical examination and initial vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 37.0\u2103; pulse rate, 66 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and blood pressure, 140/90 mmHg. Her height and body weight were 158 cm and 66 kg. She had a 10-year history of hypertension with good blood pressure control from oral Valsartan (40 mg/day). Her familial history was unremarkable. Laboratory examinations showed a low white blood cell count of 3,920/\u00b5L, a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/L, and a platelet count of 124,000/\u00b5L. The liver function test results were as follows: serum aspartate transaminase: 14 U/L; alanine transaminase: 19 U/L; alkaline phosphatase: 88 IU/L; gamma-glutamyl transferase: 16 U/L; total bilirubin: 4.05 \u00b5mol/L; albumin, 35.7 g/L; and international normalized ratio: 0.93. CA 19-9 and \u03b1-FP were assayed for a malignancy workup, with results of 16.35 U/mL and 2.61 ng/mL, respectively. The results for viral markers including HBV surface antigen and anti-HCV were negative. Abdominal CT revealed an atrophic left lobar and dilated bile duct with the middle hepatic vein close to the cystic lesion (). Abdominal MRCP revealed irregular intrahepatic bile duct dilatation (IHBDD) of the left lobe with the left hepatic duct obstructed, while the common bile duct and right intrahepatic bile duct were normal (). However, we found that the irregular cystic dilatation of the bile duct was limited to the left liver and contained stones inside the cysts. No obvious abnormal dilated bile duct was found in the right liver. The common bile duct and the hepatic duct were normal, and no obvious dilatation was found. This patient was diagnosed with Caroli disease (type V). The surgical indication for the patient was explicit. However, the treatment prescription required consideration of the cystic wall being adjacent to the middle hepatic vein, the left hepatic atrophy and structure disorder, and the observation that the left hepatic vein was not visible. Although complete resection of the cysts may be a curative treatment for unilobar Caroli disease, this treatment was impossible for this patient due to the close adherence of the middle hepatic vein to the cystic wall. Therefore, we decided to perform laparoscopic left LR for the patient, while preserving a partial cystic wall close to the middle hepatic vein.\r\nThe standard laparoscopic equipment used to perform laparoscopic hepatectomy included a 30\u00b0 5-mm laparoscope, a hook dissector, 5-mm laparoscopic forceps, a 5-mm atraumatic grasper, a 10-mm GIA (Johnson & Johnson Medical, Shanghai, China), 5-mm harmonic (Johnson & Johnson Medical) and 10-mm locking pliers.\r\nThe conventional fully laparoscopic multiport approach was adopted. The patient was placed in a supine position, and the surgeon stood on the right side. Under general anesthesia, five 5- to 10-mm incisions were made in a \u201cU\u201d configuration. Division of the liver parenchyma was performed with Harmonic or Endo-GIA. Large pedicles were stapled or clipped.\r\nUpon surgical exploration, the left lobe of the liver was found to be atrophied, and the right liver had developed compensatory hyperplasia with a red-brown and smooth surface. However, the left liver lobe was severely adherent. We gradually dissected the adhesion using harmonic pliers and exposed the atrophic left lobe (5 cm \u00d7 6 cm \u00d7 2 cm). The gallbladder was approximately 7 cm \u00d7 4 cm \u00d7 2 cm in size and was filled with bile and gallstones. Through intraoperative exploration, we confirmed the diagnosis of Caroli disease, limited to the left lobe of the liver. We obtained a biopsy from the edge of the lesion and performed a rapid intraoperative pathological examination to exclude malignant tumor. We then decided to perform a laparoscopic left liver and gallbladder resection. The difficulty was that the lesion was close to the middle hepatic vein. We opened the cysts and resected most of the lesion while retaining part of cystic wall close to the middle hepatic vein. After laparoscopic left half-liver and gallbladder resection, the liver lesion tissue and gallbladder were removed completely from the abdominal cavity. Histopathologic findings showed congenital dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, confirming the preoperative diagnosis of Caroli disease (). Histopathology of the resected specimen revealed large, cystic dilations of the large intrahepatic bile ducts. This patient was seen regularly every 3 months at the outpatient department.

The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 94.0.\r\nThe patient's temperature is 99.5 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 67.5 = 37.5 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 94.0.\r\nThe patient's pH is 7.42.

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mEq. To convert from 136.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 136.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 136.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 136.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 136.0 mmol sodium/L.

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 6.4 mmol. To convert 6.4 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 6.4 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.006 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.006 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 1.081 g glucose. To convert 1.081 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.081 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 1081.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1081.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 108.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 6.4 mmol glucose/L converts to 108.1 mg glucose/dL.

We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 136.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 136.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 136.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 136.0 mEq sodium/L. \r\nThe concentration of chloride is 112.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 112.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 112.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 112.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 112.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 112.0 mEq chloride/L. \r\nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 16.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 16.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 16.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 16.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 16.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \r\nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 136.0 mEq/L - (112.0 mEq/L + 16.0 mEq/L) = 8.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 8.0 mEq/L.\r\nPlugging in 8.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 8.0 - 12 = -4.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is -4.0 mEq/L.\r\nPlugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get -4.0 mEq/L / 8.0 mEq/L = -0.5.

Patient was also oliguric therefore, the decision was made to take him immediately for exploratory laparotomy for treatment of abdominal compartment syndrome. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a cirrhotic liver without signs of injury and a two-centimeter grade 1 splenic laceration at the lower pole which was not actively bleeding. A total of nine liters of bloody ascites were evacuated from the abdomen. The abdomen was left open and a Bogota bag was sutured to the fascia. He was transfused a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells, 4 units of fresh frozen plasma and a unit of platelets during the procedure.\r\nHe was brought back to the operating room (OR) two days later and was found to have active bleeding at the anterior surface of the hilum of the spleen. This was cauterized, stopping the bleeding. On hospital day four he was taken back to the OR and the abdomen was closed. He was extubated on hospital day seven. Hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury which resolved, as well as seizures attributed to alcohol withdrawal treated with chlordiazepoxide. Patient was discharged home and at a clinic follow-up two months post hospitalization he was noted to be doing well and abstaining from alcohol.", "Question": "What is the patient's Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index?", "LLM Answer": "4.01", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "3.822", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Fibrosis-4 is Fib-4 = (Age * AST) / (Platelet count (in billions) * \u221aALT), where platelet count is the number of billions per L, and the units for AST and ALT are both U/L.\r\nThe patient's concentration of AST is 213.0 U/L.\r\nThe patient's concentration of ALT is 309.0 U/L.\r\nThe patient's concentration of platelets is 149000.0 count/\u00b5L. To convert 149000.0 count/\u00b5L of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L which will give 149000.0 platelets count/\u00b5L * 1000000.0 \u00b5L/L = 149000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 149000000000.0/(10^9) = 149.0 billion platelet counts per liter.\r\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get (47 * 213.0)/(149.0 * sqrt(309.0)) = 3.822.\r\nHence, the Fibrosis-4 score is 3.822.", "Result": "Correct"}

Her height was 155.5 cm and body weight was 61.0 kg. Laboratory data showed a creatinine of 1.4 mg/dl, potassium 2.8 mmol/l, calcium 9.5 mg/dl, phosphorus 2.5 mg/dl, uric acid 1.5 mg/dl, normoglycaemic glycosuria and metabolic acidemia (pH 7.30, HCO3\u2212 17.4 mmol/l) (Table ). Bilateral transcervical fractures were confirmed by MRI (Fig. ) and bone scintigraphy showed multiple hot spots in her joints and ribs, compatible with osteomalacia (Fig. ). Hypophosphatemic osteomalacia was diagnosed clinically from a low serum level of phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (11.0 pg/dl), high levels of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (67.5 IU/l), and the findings of bone scintigram, although a bone biopsy was not performed. Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) was ruled out by total body survey with whole body computed tomography or endoscopic surveillances and a normal blood FGF23 (22.1 pg/ml, 10\u201350 pg/ml) level.\r\nUrinalysis showed pH 6.0 and twenty four hour urine demonstrated a low renal fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphate (Tmp/GFR 0.91), increased fractional excretion of uric acid (FEUA 43.9 %) and generalized aminoaciduria.\r\nThe calculated anion gap was 12.4 meq/l, with an inappropriately alkaline urine (pH 6.0), suggestive of distal type of renal tubular acidosis (RTA). An intravenous bicarbonate loading test to assess the tubular dysfunction demonstrated that the increased fractional excretion of bicarbonate (FEHCO3\u2212 13.25 %) and urine-blood (UB) Pco2 gradient (U-Bpco2 50.1 mmHg), suggesting the presence of proximal type of RTA. NH4Cl loading test was not performed because of the presence of apparent metabolic acidemia. These biochemical data of blood and urine indicated Fanconi syndrome with proximal type of RTA. Tests for anti-SSA and anti-SSB were negative and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were normal. Furthermore, serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed no monoclonal component. Any of the patient\u2019s medication did not seem to be related to Fanconi syndrome. Light microscopic examination of a kidney biopsy demonstrated cellular infiltration of interstitium and proximal tubular epithelium composed mainly of CD3+ lymphocytes without glomerular involvement, consistent with features of TIN (Fig. ,).\r\nThe patient was also suspected to be diagnosed as PBC because of high levels of alkaline phosphatase (663 IU/l), high serum IgM levels (1084 mg/dl) and the presence of anti-mitochondrial M2 antibody (1:10).

During the physical examination, medial ankle tenderness and mild swelling were present, with a VAS score of 6 or 7, but the range of ankle motion was normal. Ankle X-rays, computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were conducted and a medial talus osteochondral lesion with subchondral cyst formation was detected (Fig. ). Various laboratory tests detected high levels of uric acid (568 \u00b5mol/L), anti-streptolysin O (130.10 IU/mL), procalcitonin (0.28 ng/mL) and a high level of serum C-reactive protein (39.50 mg/L). The patient\u2019s erythrocyte sedimentation rate, blood cell counts, and other biochemical indexes were all within the normal range. He was primarily diagnosed with a Hepple stage V type talus osteochondral lesion, but the etiology was not clear. An ankle arthroscopy was conducted, and we found a few gouty tophus deposits in the talus articular cartilage and synovial tissue. The medial, central talus articular cartilage was soft, uneven and partially defective, with gouty tophus deposits. A 1.5-mm K-wire was drilled into this site to confirm the talus lesion site under C-arm fluoroscopy. A medial curved incision was made on the medial malleolus and the talus osteochondral lesion was exposed after inverted V-shaped medial malleolus osteotomy and removed with trephine; the removed lesions were found to be gouty tophus (Fig. ), which was further confirmed by the finding of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) crystals in postoperative histological sections (Fig. ). After complete debridement of these lesions, the lesion site was not a regular shape, and a very small amount of normal osteochondral tissue was cut with a small osteotome to form a square lesion site. Then an osteochondral block of the same size was harvested from the autologous talus neck and grafted onto the site and fixed with two 2.0 mm bioabsorbable screws. The donor site was filled and tamped with the cancellous bone on the osteotomy surface of the medial malleolus. Then the medial malleolus was fixed with three cannulated screws after reduction. Aceclofenac dispersible tablets and allopurinol were taken by the patient immediately after the operation and he was advised to use his left ankle passively, with no weight-bearing for 5 weeks. At this time his serum uric acid concentration was in the normal range and a good medial malleolus union was revealed by X-ray imaging. Partial weight-bearing was encouraged 2 months postoperatively when the cyst talus osteochondral lesion had disappeared and was replaced with normal bone tissue 6 months postoperatively.

VZV and herpes I/II immunostains were negative. The direct immunofluorescence revealed that finely granular deposition of C3, IgM, and fibrinogen is consistent with lupus.\r\nGiven her presentation of a fever, shortness of breath, and productive cough, there was a concern for postinfectious erythema multiforme. The nucleic acid amplification tests for multiple respiratory pathogens such as Mycoplasma, influenza A, influenza H1, influenza H3, influenza A virus H1 2009, influenza B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus type 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were negative. Blood cultures did not grow any bacteria or fungal organisms. Skin wound cultures were also negative for any organisms except for skin flora. Historically, there were no preceding infections reported. Our presumptive primary diagnosis was acute on chronic cutaneous lupus with epidermal necrolysis due to noncompliance with medications; differentials included Rowell syndrome, bullous lupus, Steven\u2013Johnsons syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/mast cell activation syndrome (HLH/MAS) was also a concern given pancytopenia, fevers, elevated transaminases, and elevated ferritin. However, after further evaluation by hematology, HLH/MAS was less likely given halving of ferritin after first dose of intravenous steroids, lack of hepatosplenomegaly, lack of elevation in bilirubin and triglycerides, patient did not have persistent fevers, and soluble IL-2 receptor was 2021 pg/mL (Ref: 175.3\u2013858.2 pg/mL), needed to be greater than 2400 pg/mL (greater than 2 standard deviations of reference range) to meet criteria, and clinical picture was also not as critical as usually seen. The clinical picture of atypical EM-like lesions, presence of chilblains, speckled ANA pattern, elevated anti-Ro/SSA, and absence of infectious or pharmacologic triggers in a patient with SLE confirmed our suspicion for Rowell syndrome.\r\nDue to the extensive skin surface area involvement, the patient was treated with vancomycin intravenously for primary and secondary skin infection. Gram-negative coverage was held due to severe allergy to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The pancytopenia was suspected due to an acute flare of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient was initially started on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg intravenously daily. Given more than 60% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, the patient was transferred to the burn unit for extensive debridement and multifaceted wound care. Mycophenolate mofetil was held given the elevated transaminases. Pulse doses of intravenous methylprednisolone were escalated to 1000 mg intravenous daily for three days given the concern for acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with epidermal necrosis and concomitant MAS. After normalization of transaminases, negative testing for latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, and negative blood cultures, the patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 intravenously at day 0 and day 15 with excellent maintenance of remission of skin disease and cytopenias. This dose was chosen by the treating provider, given patient being dialysis dependent, thus more immunosuppressed state at baseline and recent elevation in transaminases.\r\nIt was reassuring that early suspicion for MAS appeared steroid-responsive to pulse intravenous methylprednisolone. The soluble IL-2 receptor alpha measurement was not elevated, and serum ferritin halved after the first dose of pulse steroids. Despite the improvements in serum and systemic symptoms, the skin manifestations were slow to respond. During 2-week and 12-week follow-up of the patient, there has been maintenance of clear skin without any active cutaneous lupus manifestations. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) was 0 at 12-week follow-up.", "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio?", "LLM Answer": "0.64", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "3", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\r\nTo compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\r\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\r\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\r\nThe concentration of sodium is 138.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 138.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 138.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 138.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 138.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 138.0 mEq sodium/L. \r\nThe concentration of chloride is 98.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 98.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 98.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 98.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 98.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 98.0 mEq chloride/L. \r\nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 21.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 21.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 21.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 21.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 21.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \r\nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (98.0 mEq/L + 21.0 mEq/L) = 19.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 19.0 mEq/L.\r\nThe concentration of albumin is 3.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 19.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.2 (in g/dL)) = 21.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 21.0 mEq/L.\r\nPlugging in 21.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 21.0 - 12 = 9.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 9.0 mEq/L.\r\nPlugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 9.0 mEq/L / 3.0 mEq/L = 3.0. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 3.0.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable. Starting 3 years prior to the current presentation, the patient had gradually developed a gait disturbance, for which she consulted a local orthopedic surgery department, and upon diagnosis of knee osteoarthrosis received conservative therapy. At approximately 1 week before admissions, she had begun to experience loss of appetite and vomiting, and consulted a local physician. On suspicion of gastrointestinal disease, a thorough examination of the gastrointestinal tract was performed, but no organic disease was identified. Although the loss of appetite and vomiting resolved spontaneously, the gait disturbance gradually worsened, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head revealed ventricular enlargement. The patient was thus referred to our department for suspected iNPH related to the gait disturbance.\r\nHer height of 148.3 cm, weight of 54.4 kg, and body mass index of 24.8 were all within standard ranges. There was no medical history that could have led to secondary hydrocephalus. There were no abnormalities in vital signs with body temperature 36 \u00b0C, blood pressure 110/63 mm/Hg, and heart rate 83 beats per minute. Although the patient\u2019s consciousness was clear, 15 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and there was no muscle weakness, she walked with her legs apart in short quick steps, and required a walking aid. While muscle tonus was normal, the patient complained of mild pain when extending the knee. As to higher order brain functions, mini mental state examination (MMSE) results were 24/30, and the frontal assessment battery (FAB) results were 9/18. Blood test findings at the time of admission were within normal range apart from mild hypoalbuminemia (total protein 4.6 g/dL, albumin 2.7 g/dL, total cholesterol 147 mg/dL, and LDL cholesterol 100 mg/dL), and elevated thyroid free T3 (TSH 4.333 \u03bcIU/mL, free T3 3.78 pg/mL, free T4 1.16 ng/dL). There were no blood-sugar or electrolyte (Na 140 mmol/L, Cl 106 mmol/, K 4.1 mmol/L, serum glucose 73 mg/dL) abnormalities. Head MRI revealed enlargement of all cerebral ventricles, with an Evan\u2019s index of 0.4, and the Sylvian fissure appeared wide open consistent with iNPH. However, the specific feature of narrowing of the sulci at the high convexity area was not obvious (Fig. ). Single-photon emission computed tomography revealed reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) surrounding the Sylvian fissure, with relatively increased CBF in the convexity, which was consistent with the pattern for iNPH (Fig. ). Findings for the sulci at the high convexity area were inconsistent with typical iNPH, however, and we thus reconsidered the possibility of other diseases that may have caused the gait disturbance.\r\nDetailed tests were ultimately performed after hospital admission including a spinal tap. Following admission, the patient gradually became less active, and tended to stay in bed. Re-examination revealed blood sugar levels of 40 mg/dL and systolic blood pressure of 90 mm/Hg. On suspicion of impaired anterior pituitary function, scans were performed of the pituitary in the diencephalon, and baseline pituitary hormone levels were verified. The spinal tap results were negative. On MRI, pituitary gland was normal measuring 12 mm in maximum diameter with no enlargement or deviation of stalk, and there were no neoplastic lesions, inflammatory lesions in the pituitary area of the diencephalon, or changes suggesting that surgery had been performed in all sequences including contrast-enhanced dynamic images (Fig. ). Table presents baseline hormone levels, and Table the results of the anterior pituitary gland hormone loading test using corticotrophin releasing hormone, thyrotropin releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, and growth hormone releasing hormone. Pituitary hormone results included ACTH <1.0 pg/ml (normal range: 7.2\u201363.3), and cortisol levels <1.0 \u03bc/dL (normal range: 4.0\u201318.3), indicating pituitary adrenal insufficiency. There were no decreases in other hormone levels, with relatively mild elevations of growth hormone, prolactin and free T3 levels. We checked carefully again the medical history of the patient, but there were no recent history of exogenous glucocorticoid treatment. An additional pituitary stimulation test was performed, in which ACTH and cortisol responses only were found to have disappeared, and isolated ACTH deficiency was thus diagnosed (Fig. ). After initiation of hydrocortisone supplements, her gait quickly improved. While observing the clinical symptoms, hydrocortisone (Cortril \u00ae) was adjusted to a daily dose of 15 mg, and after instructing the patient as to how to respond on sick days, she was discharged to return home. At approximately 6 months after discharge, although the ventricular enlargement on MRI was same as before, the patient scored 27/30 points on the MMSE and 15/18 points on the FAB.", "Question": "What is the patient's Framingham Risk Score?", "LLM Answer": "name 'N' is not defined", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "0", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's gender is Female.\r\nFor females, the formula for computing the framingham risk score is 31.764001 * ln(age) + 22.465206 * ln(total_cholestrol) - 1.187731 * ln(hdl_cholestrol) + 2.552905 * ln(sys_bp) + 0.420251 * bp_medicine + 13.07543 * smoker + -5.060998 * ln(age) * ln(total_cholestrol) + -2.996945 * ln(age_smoke) * smoker - 146.5933061, where 'bp_medicine' is a binary variable for whether a patient's blood pressure is being treated with medicine, total cholestrol and hdl cholestrol are in mg/dL, and 'smoker' is whether the patient is a smoker or not.\r\nFrom this, we use the risk score to get likelihood for a patient getting myocardial infraction (MI) or dying in the next 10 years: 1 - 0.9402^exp(risk_score), where risk_score is the value from the formula above.\r\nThe patient is 65 years old. The note does not specify whether the patient is a smoker and so we assume this to be false, making the smoking variable equal to 0.\r\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 90.0 mm Hg.\r\nThe patient has been specified to not take medication for treating their blood pressure, making the bp_medicine variable equal to 0.\r\nThe concentration of total cholestrol is 147.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of total cholestrol is 147.0 mg. To convert 147.0 mg of total cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 147.0 mg total cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.147 g total cholestrol. To convert from grams of total cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.147 g/(386.65 g total cholestrol/mol) = 0.00038 mol total cholestrol. To convert 0.00038 mol of total cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.00038 mol total cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.38 mmol total cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.38 mmol total cholestrol/0.1 L = 3.8 mmol total cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 147.0 mg total cholestrol/dL converts to 3.8 mmol total cholestrol/L. \r\nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 100.0 mg/dL. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mg to mmol. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 100.0 mg. To convert 100.0 mg of hdl cholestrol to g, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 100.0 mg hdl cholestrol * 0.001 g/mg = 0.1 g hdl cholestrol. To convert from grams of hdl cholestrol to moles, divide by the molar mass 386.65 g/mol, which will give 0.1 g/(386.65 g hdl cholestrol/mol) = 0.000259 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.000259 mol of hdl cholestrol to mmol, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.000259 mol hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mmol/mol = 0.259 mmol hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is dL and the target volume unit is L. The conversion factor is 0.1 L for every unit of dL. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 0.1 to get the final concentration in terms of mmol/L. This will result to 0.259 mmol hdl cholestrol/0.1 L = 2.59 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. The concentration value of 100.0 mg hdl cholestrol/dL converts to 2.59 mmol hdl cholestrol/L. \r\nPlugging in these values will give us the risk score: 31.764001 * ln(65) + 22.465206 * ln(3.8) - 1.187731 * ln(2.59) + 2.552905 * ln(90.0) + 0.420251 * 0 + 13.07543 * 0 + -5.060998 * ln(65) * ln(3.8) + -2.996945 * ln(65) * 0 - 146.5933061 = -1.9.\r\nPlugging this into the MI risk formula gives us 1 - 0.98767^exp(-1.9) = 0.0 %.\r\nThe patient's percentage of getting MI or dying is 0.0 %.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 75.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 115.0 mm Hg = 88.333 mm Hg.\r\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 88.333 mm Hg.\r\nBecause the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 7.\r\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 7.\r\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 7.\r\nBecause the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 7. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 7. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 7. Because the patient's creatinine level is between 0.6 and 1.4, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 7.\r\nBecause the patient's hemocratit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 7. Because the patient's white blood cell count is above 40 x10^9/L, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total 7 + 4 = 11.\r\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 15.0, and so we add 15.0 points to the total making the current total 15.0 + 11 = 26.0. Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 26.0.", "Result": "Incorrect"}
