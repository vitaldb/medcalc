On physical examination, she was only able to speak in two-word sentences. There were bilateral coarse crackles all over the chest. She did not have any focal neurological deficits. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal abnormal heart sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreather mask. However, the patient kept taking off her nonrebreather mask, continued to have worsening hypoxia, and eventually required tracheal intubation. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure ).\r\nShe was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was chosen due to patient's critical condition and unclear etiology of the infecting pathogen.

Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, benzodiazepine, and opiates. Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were negative. Influenza A was positive on rapid antigen testing and the patient was started on oseltamivir. This raised our concern for secondary bacterial pneumonia from MRSA as a complication of influenza virus infection. The patient had computed tomography (CT) of the chest that showed right upper, middle, and lower lobe consolidations with cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma (Figures , ).\r\nSputum culture and blood cultures grew MRSA that was sensitive to both vancomycin and clindamycin, confirming our diagnosis. Vancomycin had already been started on admission and was continued. Fluid resuscitation was also done early in the course, but eventually progressed to septic shock. The patient was then started on norepinephrine infusion and vasopressin infusion for blood pressure support. She then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her hypoxia became refractory to conventional ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered. She had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5%. Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be acute and related to sepsis. She was managed for septic and cardiogenic shock, and venous-arterial ECMO was started. She was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for hypervolemia refractory to diuresis, inotropic and vasopressor support. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) five days later showed that the EF recovered to 45%. She continued to remain intubated for 16 days and a repeat CT chest showed worsening and multiple cavitary lesions in the right lung (Figures , ).\r\nA repeat TTE showed EF of 60% and normal left and right heart function. ECMO was stopped and she was decannulated on day 9, CRRT was stopped on day 9. Unfortunately, she did not tolerate withdrawal of ECMO and continued to deteriorate and became difficult to wean from the ventilator. Given her lack of response to vancomycin, she was switched to daptomycin and linezolid, and the vancomycin was discontinued.

Plugging in the values, we get 2/3 * 76.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 128.0 mm Hg = 93.333 mm Hg.\r\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 93.333 mm Hg.\r\nBecause the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\r\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 70 and 109 beats per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\r\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 12 and 24 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10.\r\nBecause the patient's pH is between 7.33 and 7.49, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10. Because the patient's hemocratit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 10. Because the patient's white blood cell count is above 40 x10^9/L, 4 points are added to the score, making the current total 10 + 4 = 14.\r\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 15.0, and so we add 15.0 points to the total making the current total 15.0 + 14 = 29.0. Hence, the patient's APACHE II score is 29.0.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Patient had total parathyroidectomy and partial thyroidectomy three weeks ago for primary hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid adenomas. Serum calcium level at the referring facility was 21 mg/dL. EKG showed prolonged QTc of 476 ms and nonspecific ST-T wave changes, she denied chest pain and troponin levels were <0.015. At the time of admission in our facility, her vital signs were temperature 97.9 F, heart rate 87 bpm, respiratory rate 16/min and blood pressure 163/67 mmHg. She was alert and oriented, had normal reflexes through symmetrically decreased muscle strength in all four extremities with mild generalized abdominal tenderness. Rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. Patient\u2019s initial laboratory values showed white blood cell (WBC) count of 15.5 k/mm3, hemoglobin (Hb) of 15.6 gm/dL, platelet count of 370 k/mm3, creatinine of 1.9 mg/dL (baseline was 0.8), BUN of 45 mg/dL, eGFR of 27 mL/min (baseline eGFR >60 mL/min), bicarbonate of 33 mEq/L, chloride of 94 mEq/L, potassium of 2.5 mEq/L, sodium of 135 mEq/L, total calcium of 23 mg/dL with ionized calcium of 12.03 mg/dL, phosphate of 1.3 mg/dL and PTH of 0.

Her diet included a glass of milk after each meal. As explained earlier, a diagnosis of CATS was made, and treatment was started. It was obvious from history that hypercalcemia was due to excessive calcium intake so calcium, vitamin D supplements and chlorthalidone were stopped. Irbesartan contributing to AKI was also stopped. Aggressive hydration was instituted with intravenous (IV) normal saline 150-200 mL/hour with 4L given in the first 24 hours. Furosemide 40 mg twice daily was also started. Patient didn\u2019t require calcitonin. Due to the anticipated serious risk of late hypocalcemia owing to parathyroidectomy, bisphosphonates were not considered. Patient improved clinically and her symptoms resolved, she was discharged on hospital day 5, with total calcium level reduced to 10.3 mg/dL and ionized calcium to 5.77 mg/dL.

On initial examination, her vital signs included a temperature of 100.9\u00b0F, heart rate of 140 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute and blood pressure of 103/66 mmHg. On physical examination, she was only able to speak in two-word sentences. There were bilateral coarse crackles all over the chest. She did not have any focal neurological deficits. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal abnormal heart sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreather mask. However, the patient kept taking off her nonrebreather mask, continued to have worsening hypoxia, and eventually required tracheal intubation. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure ).\r\nShe was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was chosen due to patient's critical condition and unclear etiology of the infecting pathogen. The patient had a white cell count of 11.8 x 103/microliter (\u00b5L) that trended to 2.2 x 103/\u00b5L, normal troponins, and a lactic acid of 1.8 mmol/Liter (L) initially that trended up to 2.5 mmol/L. Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, benzodiazepine, and opiates. Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were negative. Influenza A was positive on rapid antigen testing and the patient was started on oseltamivir. This raised our concern for secondary bacterial pneumonia from MRSA as a complication of influenza virus infection. The patient had computed tomography (CT) of the chest that showed right upper, middle, and lower lobe consolidations with cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma (Figures , ).\r\nSputum culture and blood cultures grew MRSA that was sensitive to both vancomycin and clindamycin, confirming our diagnosis. Vancomycin had already been started on admission and was continued. Fluid resuscitation was also done early in the course, but eventually progressed to septic shock. The patient was then started on norepinephrine infusion and vasopressin infusion for blood pressure support. She then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her hypoxia became refractory to conventional ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered. She had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5%. Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be acute and related to sepsis. She was managed for septic and cardiogenic shock, and venous-arterial ECMO was started. She was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for hypervolemia refractory to diuresis, inotropic and vasopressor support. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) five days later showed that the EF recovered to 45%. She continued to remain intubated for 16 days and a repeat CT chest showed worsening and multiple cavitary lesions in the right lung (Figures , ).\r\nA repeat TTE showed EF of 60% and normal left and right heart function. ECMO was stopped and she was decannulated on day 9, CRRT was stopped on day 9. Unfortunately, she did not tolerate withdrawal of ECMO and continued to deteriorate and became difficult to wean from the ventilator. Given her lack of response to vancomycin, she was switched to daptomycin and linezolid, and the vancomycin was discontinued. She did not improve with new antibiotic regimen, continued to accumulate volume, and could not tolerate being off CRRT that was resumed for volume removal. Her hypoxia continued to be refractory despite all efforts.

Combined throat/nasal sampling (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania) was performed for real-time PCR (RT-PCR) SARS CoV-2 (QuantStudio v5 analysis method with TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit, The QuantStudioTM Design & Analysis Software, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pleasanton, CA, USA). The result was negative. Respiratory secretions were not collected for microbiological diagnosis.\r\nThe diagnosis of right basal pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, acute chronic liver dysfunction, and acute kidney injury was established. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. Anti-inflammatory steroid, antibiotic, antihypertensive, oxygen therapy was initiated. The patient died 17 h after presentation.\r\nThe necropsy was performed 12 h after death. Necropsy exam revealed the following: about 1700 mL of serous fluid in the right pleural cavity, with gray deposits, which were also present focally on the surface of the right pleura, and about 500 mL of serous citrine fluid in the left pleural cavity. The middle lower lobe of the right lung had a well-demarcated red-gray area, with small violaceous areas of increased consistency, having a dry, granular cross section surface. The adrenal glands showed bilateral medullary hemorrhage. No signs of autolysis were identified.\r\nGiven the persistence of the suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, five lung fragments (0.5/0.3 cm) were collected by cutting with scalpel from the red-gray area, middle lower lobe (with collection device produced by Sanimed International Impex, Bucharest, Romania). RT-PCR testing was performed on these lung fragments and the result was positive. Total RNA isolation was performed with NucleoSpin RNA for tissue (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The E gene assay (Envelope gene) was used as the first line screening tool (Ct 23) then followed by confirmatory testing with an RdRp gene assay (Ct 25.3) (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene\u2014inside the Orf1ab polyprotein gene) and N gene assay (Ct 26.5) according to the Charite/Berlin protocol [].\r\nFor the histopathological examination, we used an Olympus BX40 microscope (Tokyo, Japan) with an Olympus Camedia 4040 photo camera, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain (staining kit produced by Laboratorium, Bucharest, Romania), Giemsa stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) stain (staining kit produced by Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and Grocott stain (staining kit produced in our own laboratory). For immunohistochemistry, CD3 (Dako, polyclonal rabbit anti-human) and CD45 (Dako, monoclonal mouse antihuman, clone 2B11 + PD7/26) were used. The immunolabeling reaction was carried out by an automated immunostainer (Leica Bond-Max, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) using a polymer-based detection system (Leica Biosystems, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia) with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidin (DAB) as the chromogen.\r\nThe histopathological examination of the case evidenced preexisting lesions in various organs, which could be assigned to preexisting morbidities, favoring the severe evolution of COVID-19 infection. The histopathological examination also detected recent lesions occurring in the context of COVID-19 infection.\r\nIn the lung tissue, a background of lung fibrosis (A), with emphysematous areas (B) and thickened septa with myofibroblasts (C,D) was seen.\r\nOn this fibrosis background, the large and small arterial lung vessels show many thromboses (). The thromboses are accompanied by subpleural hemorrhagic foci (Tardieu spots, resulting from acute hypoxia), as well as by acute pulmonary edema foci in the rare alveoli unoccupied by inflammatory exudate. In the thrombosed vessels, lymphocytes adherent to the endothelium, with a significance of endotheliitis () but with low intensity, can be seen. In the dilated perivascular lymphatics, there is a cell-rich lymph fluid, with a cellularity similar to that of alveolar exudate (A).\r\nEosinophilic (A) and basophilic microthrombi (B) can also be observed, which represent aspects of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).\r\nThe alveolar exudate is rich in foam cells ( and ). Alveolar exudate immunolabeling is positive for the leukocyte common antigen (CD45, a commonly used marker of hematopoietic cells except for erythrocytes and platelets) (A), but negative for CD3 (a common antibody for identifying T cells) (B). Immunolabeling of the innate immune system cells for induced nitric oxide (iNOS) is extremely weak ().\r\nIn the alveoli filled with macrophages, cystic forms with multinuclear content were also present (B). These proved to be positive by Giemsa stain (A,B), Grocott-Gomori\u2019s methenamine silver stain (C), and PAS stain (D).\r\nGiemsa stain also evidenced the fact that focally, some alveoli were invaded by a population of filamentous bacteria, in those areas the alveolar exudate having a bronchopneumonic, bacterial superinfection appearance ().\r\nIn the pleura, the whitish exudate described macroscopically was a mixture of fibrin and basophilic granular material, rich in round cells with vesicular nuclei. These cells were positive by Giemsa and Grocott staining, supporting the diagnosis of pneumocystosis (). Starting from these pleural images suggestive of Pneumocystis, it was inferred that the foamy alveolar material phagocyted by the activated macrophages was probably identical to this basophilic granular material, and the cystic forms described in were Pneumocystis cystic forms.\r\nThe myocardial muscle fibers are hypertrophied and fragmented, and in the medium intramyocardial venous vessels, rare microthrombi are present (A). In the liver, alcoholic steatosis is seen. In the medium and large branches of the suprahepatic veins, there is inflammatory infiltrate which allows the diagnosis of phlebitis (B).

The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 101.0.\r\nThe patient's temperature is 37.8 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 101.0.\r\nThe patient's pH is 7.37. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 101.0.\r\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 19.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 101.0.\r\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 101.0.\r\nThe concentration of BUN is 22.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 101.0.\r\nThe concentration of sodium is 133.0 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 133.0 mEq. To convert from 133.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 133.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 133.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 133.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.0 mEq sodium/L converts to 133.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the scor, keeping the total at 101.0.\r\nThe concentration of glucose is 7.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 7.2 mmol. To convert 7.2 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 7.2 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.007 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.007 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 1.261 g glucose. To convert 1.261 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.261 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 1261.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1261.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 126.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 7.2 mmol glucose/L converts to 126.1 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 101.0.\r\nThe patient's hemocratit is 45.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 101.0.\r\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 75.0 mm Hg.

A detailed dietary history prior to admission was lacking. Physical exam was notable for diffuse jaundice, abdominal distention, and severe mid-thoracic back pain later confirmed to be T6/T7 vertebral fractures.\r\nInitial laboratory results showed stage 3 AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) elevated to 8.98 mg/dL from a baseline of 1.04 mg/dL.

Soon after admission, he developed hypotension necessitating vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed septic shock. AKI workup revealed deteriorating kidney function and development of anuria, requiring intermittent hemodialysis.\r\nThe etiology of renal failure remained unclear. Urine testing showed nephrotic range proteinuria, many bacteria, no red blood cells, no crystals, few hyaline casts, and no granular casts. A renal biopsy was performed and showed diffuse calcium oxalate crystal deposition with severe acute tubular injury (ATN) and mild interstitial fibrosis (). An evident cause of oxalate nephropathy was unclear, although it was suspected that pancreatic insufficiency leading to fat malabsorption and increased intestinal absorption of oxalate were responsible. Fecal elastase returned low at 54 \u03bcg Elastase/g stool to support pancreatic insufficiency while abdominal computed tomography (CT) without contrast showed exocrine atrophy of the pancreas.

We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mEq. To convert from 141.0 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 141.0 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 141.0 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 141.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed.

To convert 8.0 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 8.0 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.008 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.008 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 1.441 g glucose. To convert 1.441 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.441 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 1441.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1441.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 144.1 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 8.0 mmol glucose/L converts to 144.1 mg glucose/dL.

The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.\r\nLymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics\u2014diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration\u2014are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.", "Question": "What is the patient's Centor Score?", "LLM Answer": "2", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "1", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The current Centor score is 0.\r\nThe patient is 16.0 years old.

Results of the initial physical examination at admission indicated symmetric limb weakness with Grade V- muscle strength in all four limbs; strength was impaired in both proximal and distal muscles in the upper and lower limbs, poor stability and accuracy in the finger-to-nose and heel-to-knee-to-shin test, loss of tendon reflexes, decreased proprioception, and decreased distal superficial sensation in a glove and stocking pattern. The patient required mobility aids for walking. Neuroelectrophysiological results were as follows: motor distal latency prolongation \u226550% above the upper limit of normal values (ULN) in the bilateral peroneus and right medianus; reduction of motor conduction velocity \u226530% below the lower limit of normal values (LLN) in the bilateral medianus, right musculocutaneous nerve, femoral nerve, and left peroneus; motor conduction block, \u226530% reduction of the proximal relative to distal negative peak compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in the bilateral medianus, right ulnaris, and left peroneus; sensory conduction abnormalities (prolonged distal latency or reduced sensory nerve action potential [SNAP] amplitude or slowed conduction velocity outside of normal limits) in the medianus, ulnaris, radial nerve, peroneus supers, and suralis. This was mainly manifested in the distal lower limbs (), which fulfilled the electrophysiological diagnostic criteria for CIDP developed by the Federation of European Neuroscience Societies/Peripheral Nerve Society (1).

We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of total cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of total cholestrol is 4.75 mmol. To convert 4.75 mmol of total cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 4.75 mmol total cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.005 mol total cholestrol. To convert from mol total cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.005 mol total cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 1.933 g total cholestrol. To convert 1.933 g of total cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 1.933 g total cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 1933.0 mg total cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 1933.0 mg total cholestrol/10.0 dL = 193.3 mg total cholestrol/dL. The concentration value of 4.75 mmol total cholestrol/L converts to 193.3 mg total cholestrol/dL. \r\nThe concentration of hdl cholestrol is 1.03 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of hdl cholestrol from mmol to mg. The mass of hdl cholestrol is 1.03 mmol. To convert 1.03 mmol of hdl cholestrol to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.03 mmol hdl cholestrol * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.001 mol hdl cholestrol. To convert from mol hdl cholestrol to grams, multiply by the molar mass 386.654 g/mol, which will give 0.001 mol hdl cholestrol * 386.654 g/mol = 0.387 g hdl cholestrol. To convert 0.387 g of hdl cholestrol to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.387 g hdl cholestrol * 1000.0 mg/g = 387.0 mg hdl cholestrol. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 387.0 mg hdl cholestrol/10.0 dL = 38.7 mg hdl cholestrol/dL.

To convert 1.09 mmol of triglycerides to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 1.09 mmol triglycerides * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.001 mol triglycerides. To convert from mol triglycerides to grams, multiply by the molar mass 861.338 g/mol, which will give 0.001 mol triglycerides * 861.338 g/mol = 0.861 g triglycerides. To convert 0.861 g of triglycerides to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.861 g triglycerides * 1000.0 mg/g = 861.0 mg triglycerides.

Beside reduced levels of hemoglobin (5.6\u20137.8 mmol/L; normal range: 6.3\u20137.8 mmol/L) and platelets (90\u2013125 \u00d7 109/L; normal range: 206.000\u2013445.000 \u00d7 109/L), laboratory results were otherwise unremarkable. Results of infectious work-up [blood, cerebral spinal fluid and urine cultures, as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for respiratory viruses and pathogens for atypical pneumonia] remained negative. Because of the persisting fever, the child was transferred to three other hospitals, recently to a tertiary care hospital, where he was evaluated for immunodeficiency. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was carried out under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation because of declining general condition. Since respiratory functions had deteriorated dramatically, the child was transferred to our institution for ECMO-support (at 4 wk after first presentation). No definite diagnosis existed to that time.\r\nMedical history taking with the parents revealed an uneventful pregnancy and birth in Germany. The parents originated from the Balkan peninsula. The patient was the first child and the parents claimed to be healthy.\r\nThe child was unconscious due to deep analgo-sedation (Glasgow coma score of 3/15). The vesical temperature was 40.3\u00b0C, heart rate was 142 bpm, blood pressure was 82/44 mmHg (under continuous infusion with epinephrine 2.0 mcg/kg/min), weight was 7.9 kg (15th percentile, World Health Organization scale), length was 70 cm (30th percentile, World Health Organization scale), SpO2 was 70%. The pressure-controlled ventilation maintained peak inspiratory pressure of 60 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 12 cm H2O, FiO2 of 1.0, frequency of 40 pm, and Horovitz quotient of 30. The spleen was 5 cm and the liver 6 cm, palpable in midclavicular lines. Our first clinical impression was that of a systemic infection with severe acute respiratory failure and unexplained lymphoproliferation.\r\nBlood analysis revealed pancytopenia (hemoglobin: 4.3 mmol/L; leucocytes: 2.600 \u00d7 109/L; neutrophils: 800 \u00d7 109/L; platelets: 32.000 \u00d7 109/L), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (194 mg/L; normal range: <5 mg/L), ferritin (1,020 \u03bcg/L; normal range: 14\u2013103 \u03bcg/L), triglycerides (3.58 mmol/L normal range: 0.4\u20131.6mmol/L), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (30,247 U/mL; normal range: 158\u2013623 U/mL). Analyses of arterial blood gases showed pH of 6.9, pCO2 of 93 mmHg, pO2 of 30 mmHg, and base-excess of \u221211.1 mmol/L.\r\nInitial imaging with x-ray showed a \u201cwhite lung\u201d () and with ultrasound showed hepato- and splenomegaly. Further imaging work-up, with either computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, could not be performed because of the instable situation.\r\nBone marrow biopsy showed a distinct hemophagocytosis upon cytologic evaluation (). The lymphocyte population consisted of CD3+ of 1,358 \u00d7 109/L, CD4+ of 1,119 \u00d7 109/L, CD8+ of 2,017 \u00d7 109/L, CD19+ of 487 \u00d7 109/L, and CD56+ of 2 \u00d7 109/L. Further immunological studies by fluorescence-activated cell sorting revealed normal fresh degranulation of natural killer cells (14.7%; normal: >10%), and normal expressions of perforin, CD27, SAP, and XIAP on d 7. Microscopy of the patient's hairs showed no anomaly of pigmentation, as would be found in children with Griscelli syndrome.\r\nThe patient was further evaluated with cultures of blood, urine, tracheal secretion, and stool. Examinations for ova or parasites provided negative results. All serological and PCR tests for viruses (Epstein\u2013Barr, human immunodeficiency, cytomegaly, hanta, adeno, influenza a/b, respiratory syncytial, herpes simplex, corona, metapneumonia, parvo B19, parainfluenza, rhino, and enterovirus) were negative. Also negative were results of testing for leishmania, legionella, aspergillus, Pneumocystis jirovecii, Hemophilus influenza b, and pneumococcus-PCR/immunoglobulins (IgG/IgM).\r\nAll tumors markers \u03b1-fetoprotein (2.5 IU/mL), neuron-specific enolase (10 ng/mL), \u00df-hCG (0.2 mIU/mL), homovanillic acid (10 mg/g creatinine), and vanillylmandelic acid (18 mg/g creatinine) were unrevealing.\r\nA positive result from the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) was the first indication for possible TBC infection on d 12. However, microscopy for acid-fast bacilli (Ziehl\u2013Neelsen stain) as well as PCR testing for TBC in the first bronchoalveolar lavage were both negative on d 6. Further along in the clinical course, PCR for TBC became positive and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid culture returned positive results on d 40. The identified strain of M. tuberculosis was found to be sensitive to rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and isoniazid, retrospectively.\r\nAfter discontinuation of the ECMO therapy, further imaging was performed. Magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system showed a miliary TBC and a computed tomography scan of the thorax revealed a calcified, round lesion consistent with TBC ().\r\nNormal functional assays virtually excluded hereditary forms of HLH. A secondary form was therefore recommended to be considered, as was a complete diagnostic re-evaluation (infection, tumor, leukemia). The etoposide (VP-16, according to the HLH-04 protocol) was terminated after three doses administered according the HLH protocol.\r\nThe child presented with severe hypoxia, and respiratory and metabolic acidosis, despite pressure-controlled ventilation and attempts of high frequency oscillation ventilation, both at high inspiratory oxygen level. The decision was therefore made to start veno-venous ECMO immediately after admission of the patient (see ). A 16F Avalon double-lumen cannula (Getinge AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) was inserted in the right internal jugular vein. A blood flow of 120 mL/kg/min was established, which was sufficient to achieve a PaO2 between 85 and 95 mmHg, and a PaCO2 between 40 and 50 mmHg. Ventilator parameters were reduced as much as possible (peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cm H2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 6 cm H2O, and FiO2 of 0.4) to guarantee \u201clung protection\u201d as well as a transcutaneous O2-saturation of >90%. After initiation of the ECMO catecholamine support with epinephrine and noradrenaline (maximum dosage of 0.18 \u03bcg/kg/min) was progressively weaned (until d 12).\r\nBecause of the fulfillment of criteria for HLH therapy, the HLH-94 protocol was initiated. The boy was treated with dexamethasone at 10 mg/m2 (d 2 to d 12, and reduced/discontinued at d 24) and etoposide at 150 mg/m2 (three doses in total, given on d 2 through d 7 and being stopped upon normal results from the T cell degranulation assay on d 7). Additionally, intravenous immunoglobulin (0.5 g/kg body weight, given on d 2 through d 15) was administered.\r\nWith the suspicion of TBC, on d 12 (positive IRGA) a 4-fold tuberculostatic therapy was started, consisting of rifampicin at 1 \u00d7 15 mg/kg body weight/d, ethambutol at 1 \u00d7 30 mg/kg body weight/d, pyrazinamide at 1 \u00d7 30 mg/kg body weight/d, and isoniazid 1 \u00d7 10 mg/kg body weight/d). At 10 d after the start of tuberculostatic therapy, there was improvement in the general condition (stable cardiorespiratory situation, rising tidal volumes). The C-reactive protein level declined from 194 mg/L to 5 mg/L on d 28, followed by the soluble interleukin-2 receptor from 30,247 U/mL to 931 U/mL on d 40. After full lung recovery, the ECMO support was able to be discontinued on d 28. The child was extubated on d 33.\r\nThe boy survived this critical condition. After discharge on d 66, the child was re-evaluated on d 98, d 460, and d 745. During that time, the boy developed frontotemporal hygroma (left side > right side) with spontaneous resolution. Neurological assessment during the follow-up period revealed a mild retardation of development (speech and fine motor skills) and moderate aggressive behavior with beginning improvement.", "Question": "Based on the patient's weight, what is the patient's maintenance fluid in mL/hr?", "LLM Answer": "29", "LLM Explanation": "N/A", "Ground Truth Answer": "31.6", "Ground Truth Explanation": "The patient's weight is 7.9 kg.

We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 73.0 = 73.0.\r\nBecause the patient is female, we subtract 10 points from the current total, making the current total 73.0 - 10 = 63.0.\r\nThe patient is not a nursing home resident and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 63.0.\r\nNeoplastic disease is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 63.0.\r\nLiver disease history is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 63.0.\r\nCHF History is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 63.0.\r\nCerebrovascular disease history is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 63.0.\r\nRenal Disease History is reported to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 63.0.\r\nAltered Mental Status is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 20 points to the score, making the current total 63.0 + 20 = 83.0.\r\nPleural effusion on x-ray is reported to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 83.0 + 10 = 93.0.\r\nThe patient's pulse is 130.0 beats per minute. The pulse is greater or equal to than 125 beats per minute, and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 93.0 + 10 = 103.0.\r\nThe patient's temperature is 36.0 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 4.0 = 2.222 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is less than 35 degrees celsius, and so we add 15 points to the score, making the current total 103.0 + 15 = 118.0.\r\nThe patient's pH is 7.81. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 118.0.\r\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 31.0 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is greater than or equal to 30 breaths per minute and so we add 20 points to the score, making current total 118.0 + 20 = 138.0.\r\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 140.0 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 138.0.\r\nThe concentration of BUN is 28.43 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 138.0.\r\nThe concentration of sodium is 127.0 mmol/L. The patient's sodium is less than 130 mmol/L, and so we add 20 points to the score, making the current total 138.0 + 20 = 158.0.\r\nThe concentration of glucose is 17.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of glucose from mmol to mg. The mass of glucose is 17.0 mmol. To convert 17.0 mmol of glucose to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 17.0 mmol glucose * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.017 mol glucose. To convert from mol glucose to grams, multiply by the molar mass 180.16 g/mol, which will give 0.017 mol glucose * 180.16 g/mol = 3.063 g glucose. To convert 3.063 g of glucose to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 3.063 g glucose * 1000.0 mg/g = 3063.0 mg glucose. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 3063.0 mg glucose/10.0 dL = 306.3 mg glucose/dL. The concentration value of 17.0 mmol glucose/L converts to 306.3 mg glucose/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is greater than 250 mg/dL, and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 158.0 + 10 = 168.0.\r\nThe patient's hemocratit is 28.0 %. The patient's hemocratit is less than 30%, and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 168.0 + 10 = 178.0.\r\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 59.0 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is less than 60 mm Hg, and so we add 178.0 points to the score, making the current total 178.0 + 10 = 188.0.\r\nThe patient's PSI score is 188.0.", "Result": "Incorrect"}

Chest X-ray showed mild emphysema but no sign of infection. The patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome but was unable to undergo pathological biopsy due to a renal cyst. He was administered full-dose glucocorticoid therapy alone, with no other immunosuppression. Three weeks later, while still under this treatment, the patient suffered lower limb cellulitis. His procalcitonin (PCT) was 0.3 ng/ml, and he was administrated mupirocin ointment and IV cefuroxime. After those treatments, his status improved and he continued to take oral glucocorticoids after discharge from the hospital.\r\nHowever, over the next ten days, the patient seemed to get worse and had to return to the hospital due to persistent fever, cough, and intermittent abdominal pain. Initial vitals on admission were temperature 37.8 \u00b0C, BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 125, respiratory rate 26, and oxygen saturation 95%.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\r\nThe patient is 70 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\r\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 134.0 \u00b5mol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.015 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.015 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.015 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L.

Before this, he was healthy and did not have a history of digestive diseases, diabetes, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The man was a native of Chongqing, the subtropical area in southwest China. He used to be a soldier; he fought in the Vietnam War and joined the police force after returning to his hometown.\r\nIn the hospital, his initial vitals were BP 108/78 mmHg, HR 111, respiratory rate 22, and oxygen saturation 98%. Initial laboratories included white blood cells 13.32 \u00d7 109/L (neutrophils% 77.5%; lymphocytes% 13.31%; eosinophils% 0.5%), normal hemoglobin and platelets, albumin (ALB) 14.5 g/L, globulin (GLB) 19.9 g/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 78.7 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 90.9 IU/L, creatinine (Cr) 134 \u03bcmol/L, 24-hour urine protein 9.61 g, and negative antinuclear antibody spectrum (ANAs) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Chest X-ray showed mild emphysema but no sign of infection. The patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome but was unable to undergo pathological biopsy due to a renal cyst. He was administered full-dose glucocorticoid therapy alone, with no other immunosuppression. Three weeks later, while still under this treatment, the patient suffered lower limb cellulitis. His procalcitonin (PCT) was 0.3 ng/ml, and he was administrated mupirocin ointment and IV cefuroxime. After those treatments, his status improved and he continued to take oral glucocorticoids after discharge from the hospital.\r\nHowever, over the next ten days, the patient seemed to get worse and had to return to the hospital due to persistent fever, cough, and intermittent abdominal pain. Initial vitals on admission were temperature 37.8 \u00b0C, BP 90/60 mmHg, HR 125, respiratory rate 26, and oxygen saturation 95%. Laboratory tests showed white blood cells 12.36 \u00d7 109/L (neutrophils %: 83.5%; eosinophils %: 0.7%). Sputum smear and culture were negative. Imaging examinations included CT scans of the chest, which reported interstitial pneumonia (Fig. ), and the abdomen, which reported no specific findings. The patient was diagnosed with normal gastrointestinal discomfort and pulmonary bacterial infection. A proton pump inhibitor, cefoperazone sodium, and sulbactam sodium were administered. However, the patient then started display hemoptysis, passed occult blood-positive stool, and gradually fell into a state of hyperpyrexia and drowsiness. Soon, Klebsiella pneumoniae (which was sensitized to the previous antibiotic), and unexpectedly, a large number of S. stercoralis larvae (Fig. ) were found in repeated sputum specimens. Meanwhile, the parasite was also found in a repeated brown stool specimen. Blood samples showed eosinophils% reached 18.1% and PCT was 1.01 ng/ml. Because ivermectin is not available in our region, albendazole (400 mg/day) was administered for 3 consecutive days but there was no progress. Subsequently, a mechanical ventilator was administered due to continued severe hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient was unable to maintain his blood pressure and eventually died after co-infection with S stercoralis hyperinfection and the K pneumoniae found 1 week later.

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\r\nThe patient is 70 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\r\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from \u00b5mol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 134.0 \u00b5mol. To convert 134.0 \u00b5mol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/\u00b5mol = 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000134 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.015 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.015 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.015 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.0 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 134.0 \u00b5mol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.5 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.\r\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.5/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**70 * 1.0 = 49.774.\r\nHence, the GFR value is 49.774 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2.", "Result": "Correct"}

Because the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 430. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 350 and 500, we add 3 points to the total, making the current total 6.\r\nThe patient's temperature is 36.8 degrees fahrenheit.

On physical examination, she was only able to speak in two-word sentences. There were bilateral coarse crackles all over the chest. She did not have any focal neurological deficits. Cardiovascular examination did not reveal abnormal heart sounds. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. The patient was immediately placed on a nonrebreather mask. However, the patient kept taking off her nonrebreather mask, continued to have worsening hypoxia, and eventually required tracheal intubation. Chest radiograph showed right upper lobe pneumonia (Figure ).\r\nShe was started on vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam and levofloxacin, and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was chosen due to patient's critical condition and unclear etiology of the infecting pathogen.

Urine drug screen was positive for cocaine, benzodiazepine, and opiates. Urine Legionella antigen and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen were negative. Influenza A was positive on rapid antigen testing and the patient was started on oseltamivir. This raised our concern for secondary bacterial pneumonia from MRSA as a complication of influenza virus infection. The patient had computed tomography (CT) of the chest that showed right upper, middle, and lower lobe consolidations with cystic destruction of the lung parenchyma (Figures , ).\r\nSputum culture and blood cultures grew MRSA that was sensitive to both vancomycin and clindamycin, confirming our diagnosis. Vancomycin had already been started on admission and was continued. Fluid resuscitation was also done early in the course, but eventually progressed to septic shock. The patient was then started on norepinephrine infusion and vasopressin infusion for blood pressure support. She then developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Her hypoxia became refractory to conventional ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was considered. She had a transesophageal echocardiogram which showed severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, global hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (EF) of 5%. Her cardiomyopathy was felt to be acute and related to sepsis. She was managed for septic and cardiogenic shock, and venous-arterial ECMO was started. She was also started on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for hypervolemia refractory to diuresis, inotropic and vasopressor support. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) five days later showed that the EF recovered to 45%.
