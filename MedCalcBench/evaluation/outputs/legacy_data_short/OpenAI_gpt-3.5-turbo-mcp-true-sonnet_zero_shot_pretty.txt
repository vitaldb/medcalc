    "Patient Note": "An 87-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for anorexia for several days, high-grade fever from the previous day, and liver dysfunction.
Of note, he had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and angina.
Physical examination findings included: clear consciousness; height, 163 cm; weight, 48 kg; blood pressure, 66/40 mmHg; heart rate, 75/min; respiratory rate, 22/min; oxygen saturation of peripheral artery, 96%; and body temperature, 38.1 °C.
He had no surface lymphadenopathy.
Laboratory findings included: white blood cell (WBC) count, 4.2 × 109/L; hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; platelet count, 106 × 109/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1662 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 6562 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1407 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 509 IU/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), 130 IU/L; total bilirubin, 2.7 mg/dL; prothrombin time (PT), 20.3 s; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.73; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 34.4 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL.
Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E.
Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a–c).
Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted.
Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ).
On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of “acute type” ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization.\r\nGiven the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma.
This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c).
Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ).
Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f).
The causes of death were thus determined as (1) DIC and (2) ALF associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.",
    "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?",
    "LLM Answer": "25.2",
    "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault equation, I need the following information from the patient note:\\n1.
Age: 87 years old\\n2.
Weight: 48 kg\\n3.
Height: 163 cm (converting to inches: 163 cm / 2.54 = 64.17 inches)\\n4.
Serum creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL\\n5.
Sex: male\\n\\nI used the medcalc-crcl_cockcroft_gault function with these parameters.
The calculation showed that the patient's creatinine clearance is 25.2 mL/min.
The calculation also noted that the patient's ideal body weight would be 59.6 kg, and adjusted body weight would be 55.0 kg, but since the patient is underweight (BMI < 18.5), the actual weight of 48 kg was used in the calculation.",
    "Ground Truth Answer": 25.238,
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female.
The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\r\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\r\nThe patient is 87 years old.
\r\nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL.
\r\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\r\nThe patient's height is 163.0 cm, which is 163.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.63 m.
The patient's weight is 48.0 kg.
The patient's bmi is therefore 48.0 kg / (1.63 m * 1.63 m) = 18.066 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 18.1, indicating they are underweight.\r\nBecause the patient is underweight, we take the patient's weight, 48.0 kg as the patient's adjusted weight needed for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.
\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 87) * 48.0 * 1) / (1.4 * 72) = 25.238 mL/min.
Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 25.238 mL/min.",

    "Patient Note": "An 83-year-old man with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency room shortly before midnight with sharp chest pain, nausea, and dyspnea.
The patient states he has had chest discomfort and food intolerance for the past week, but that his symptoms were far worse tonight.
He notes no inciting event, recent trauma, or aggravating factors.
On exam he appears uncomfortable, anxious, and is in a semi-tripod position.
Vitals are pertinent for a heart rate of 144, systolic blood pressure in the 180 s, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 1L O2 via nasal cannula.
Of note, the patient weighed 67.2 kg, and was 173 cm tall.
Chart review showed that he had lost approximately 4 kg (last recorded weight in chart was 71.2 kg), since his last medical visit.\r\nPrimary survey was overall unremarkable.
Airway was secure, patient’s breathing improved with 3 L oxygen, breath sounds were present and equal bilaterally, vascular access was obtained, and GCS was 15.
Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient’s blood pressure to systolic 140 s.
Given this patient’s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs).
Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection.\r\nLabs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross.
EKG was unremarkable.
A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ).\r\nThe patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified.
His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential.
Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses.
Labs continued to be pending.
Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).\r\nAlong with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL.
Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia.
Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals.
Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus.
No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.\r\nThe findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient.
Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient.
The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects.
The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter.
In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.\r\nOn EGD, the patient’s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter.
The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it.
The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient’s lab derangements (Fig. ).\r\nThe decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device.
About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL).
A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning.
Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus.
In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage).
He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.\r\nThe patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night.
The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition.
The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan.
The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity.
An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.\r\nThe patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor.
During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization.
He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ).
After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis.
Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient’s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning).
He was followed up in the outpatient setting for further management.",
    "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?",
    "LLM Answer": "38.0",
    "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, I need the patient's age, weight, height, serum creatinine, and sex.
From the patient note, I can identify:\\n- Age: 83 years old\\n- Weight: 67.2 kg\\n- Height: 173 cm\\n- Serum creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL\\n- Sex: Male\\n\\nWith these values, I can apply the Cockcroft-Gault formula:\\nCrCl = [(140 - age) × weight (kg)] ÷ [72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)]\\nFor females, the result is multiplied by 0.85.\\n\\nUsing the medical calculator, the creatinine clearance is calculated to be 38.0 mL/min.",
    "Ground Truth Answer": 38.0,
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female.
The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\r\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\r\nThe patient is 83 years old.
\r\nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL.
\r\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\r\nThe patient's height is 173.0 cm, which is 173.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.73 m.
The patient's weight is 67.2 kg.
The patient's bmi is therefore 67.2 kg / (1.73 m * 1.73 m) = 22.453 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 22.5, indicating they are normal weight.\r\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.
Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 67.2 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 83) * 67.2 * 1) / (1.4 * 72) = 38.0 mL/min.

    "Patient Note": "A 51-year-old woman who presented with diarrhoea containing mucus and blood had initially been diagnosed with acute severe ulcerative pan-colitis and backwash ileitis at the age of 49 years at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) in December 2014.
She had poliomyelitis when she was very young, and there was nothing special regarding her family or psychosocial history.
Serology was positive for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) and negative for anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody (ASCA).
Her condition was refractory to steroids and complicated by Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
Ultimately, she underwent sub-total colectomy and ileostomy in February 2015.
Pathological examination of the resection specimen showed diffuse pan-colitis consistent with UC and no indications of Crohn’s disease (Fig. ).
She did well in the following 11 months; prednisone was tapered and stopped within 2 months, and she gained 5 kg of weight after the ileostomy.
In January 2016, a scheduled restorative ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) with proximal neo-ileostomy was performed.\r\nFrom one month after the IPAA, her 24-h stool collection slowly increased to 1.5–2 L.
Next, she noticed decreased urine output since April.
In early May 2016, she presented to our emergency room with repeated unconsciousness over the course of 10 days.
Her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure (BP), 74/50 mmHg; heart rate (HR), 90 bpm; additionally, she exhibited a poor nutritional status (160 cm; 39 kg).
On physical examination, active bowel sounds were noticed to occur approximately 7–9 times per minute.
Her serum creatinine level was 183 μmol/L, indicating acute kidney injury.
Treatment with fluid replacement and noradrenaline maintained her BP at 80–90/50–60 mmHg and gradually normalized her creatinine level.
However, her 24-h watery stool collection persisted, and she developed fever and vomiting.
While many leukocytes were found in stool collected from the diverted ileostomy, repeated stool cultures and tests for Clostridium difficile toxins were negative.
Tests for CMV-DNA, CMV-pp65 and EBV-DNA were performed and were all negative.
The patient was not on any medications, including NSAIDs, upon verification.
Her treatment with steroids was stopped before the end of April 2015.
Empirical treatment with antibiotics, including ceftazidime, metronidazole and oral vancomycin, was administered with no response.
Due to her reliance on noradrenaline, relative adrenal insufficiency was suspected, and hydrocortisone was initiated at 50 mg q6 h intravenously.
Her stool volume decreased to less than 500 ml per day quickly, by which time the treatment with noradrenaline was successfully stopped.
The levels of D-lactate, endotoxin and diamine oxidase indicated that the barrier function of the intestine was compromised and that bacterial translocation may have occurred.
Oedematous inflamed mucosa with patchy superficial ulcers was observed in the diverted pouch by pouchoscopy.
Although an upper endoscopy and an endoscopy through a stoma revealed a normal gross appearance in the stomach, duodenum and pre-stomal ileum (Fig. a, b), the histological examination of tissue biopsies of both the duodenum and pre-stomal ileum revealed enteritis, as indicated by moderate villous atrophy, cryptitis, decreased goblet cells, and severe active inflammation with neutrophil infiltration in the lamina propria, as well as negativity for intraepithelial lymphocytosis (Fig. a-d).
From these lines of evidence of histological enteritis presenting in the duodenum, pre-stomal ileum and diverted pouch, we considered pan-enteritis to be present, and we diagnosed the patient with post-colectomy enteritis.
The patient was treated with methylprednisolone at 30 mg intravenously once a day with tapering by 5 mg every 7 to 10 days; however, her stool volume from the ileostomy still gradually increased to 3–4 L.
After a multidisciplinary team discussion, ileostomy closure was debated as the final rescue treatment and was performed in August 2016.
Two months later, her stool volume decreased to less than 1 L per day, and she gained 2.5 kg of weight.
Azathioprine at 50 mg/d was prescribed during the tapering of prednisone.
Until the last follow-up in March 2018, she performed well, with an increase in body weight to 50 kg, and daily defecation approximately 5–6 times at less than 1 L/day, sometimes with form (Additional file ).
Gastroduodenal endoscopy and pouchoscopy were repeated annually and showed normal villi in the descending duodenum and neo-ileum in March 2018 (Fig. c, d).
Gradually, the histology changed, showing recovery of the villous atrophy, cryptitis and inflammation in the lamina propria to normal (Fig. e-f).",
    "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?",
    "LLM Answer": "19.8",
    "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation, I need to gather several parameters from the patient note:\\n\\n1.
Age: 51 years old (woman)\\n2.
Weight: 39 kg\\n3.
Height: 160 cm\\n4.

The calculator used the actual body weight because the patient is underweight based on BMI.",
    "Ground Truth Answer": 25.017,
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female.
The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\r\nThe patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\r\nThe patient is 51 years old.
\r\nThe concentration of creatinine is 183.0 µmol/L.
We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL.
Let's first convert the mass of creatinine from µmol to mg.
The mass of creatinine is 183.0 µmol.
To convert 183.0 µmol of creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 183.0 µmol creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.000183 mol creatinine.
To convert from mol creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.000183 mol creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.021 g creatinine.
To convert 0.021 g of creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.021 g creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 21.0 mg creatinine.
The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL.
The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L.
Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL.
This will result to 21.0 mg creatinine/10.0 dL = 2.1 mg creatinine/dL.
The concentration value of 183.0 µmol creatinine/L converts to 2.1 mg creatinine/dL.
\r\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\r\nThe patient's height is 160.0 cm, which is 160.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.6 m.
The patient's weight is 50.0 kg.
The patient's bmi is therefore 50.0 kg / (1.6 m * 1.6 m) = 19.531 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 19.5, indicating they are normal weight.\r\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.
Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 50.0 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 51) * 50.0 * 0.85) / (2.1 * 72) = 25.017 mL/min.
Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 25.017 mL/min.",

\r\nFor females, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:\r\nIBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)\r\nPlugging in the values gives us 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg * (62.992 (in inches) - 60) = 52.382 kg.\r\nHence, the patient's IBW is 52.382 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).\r\nTo compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)).
ABW = 52.382 kg + 0.4 * (105.0 kg  - 52.382 kg) = 73.429 kg.
The patient's adjusted body weight is 73.429 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 42) * 73.429 * 0.85) / (0.8 * 72) = 106.192 mL/min.
Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 106.192 mL/min.",

    "Patient Note": "A 45-year-old, 58 kg, 156 cm woman presented with increased and prolonged vaginal bleedings.
A physical examination and an ultrasound showed a submucosal leiomyoma of the uterus.
There were no other symptoms or pathological findings.
Preoperative blood tests, which included electrolytes analyses, a full blood exam, and coagulation parameters, showed no anomalies.
Most notably, both creatinine and sodium were within normal levels, i.e.
0.7 mg/dL and 137 mEq/L, respectively.
The patient had a history of encephalopathy during childhood of an unknown origin without sequelae, an elective caesarean section (1997) due to leiomyoma, laparoscopic myomectomy and removal of an endometrial cyst of the ovary (1999), and a second caesarean section (2000) due to an uterine instability subsequent to the first caesarean section and myomectomy.
The patient had no known allergies.
She was taking daily doses of ethinyl estradiol (0.02 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.1 mg) continuously over a period of six months.
The patient refused a hysterectomy but an endoscopic removal of the leiomyoma and an endometrial ablation was decided on, subsequent to which the patient gave written informed consent.
The patient was administered with 7.5 mg midazolam orally 60 min preoperatively.
Subsequent to placing the patient in the lithotomy position, the application of a peripheral venous catheter and the attachment of standard monitoring equipment (electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure cuff and a peripheral capillary oxygen saturation analyzer), anaesthesia was induced intravenously with propofol (2 mg/kg) and sufentanil (0.3 μg/kg).\r\nA laryngeal mask was inserted, and after the correct positioning was verified, the lungs were ventilated with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.5 and a minute volume (MV) of 74 mL/min/kg at a ventilation frequency of 10/min in volume controlled mode (IPPV).
The positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level was 0 Pa and the peak pressure was 900 Pa.
Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol (8 mg/kg/h).
After anaesthesiological clearance the endoscopy commenced.
Purisole® SM (Fresenius Kabi Inc., Germany) was utilized as the distension medium.
This standard hypotonic solution contains 27 g sorbitol and 5.4 g mannitol per liter.
A pressure of 16 kPa (120 mmHg) was applied to unfold the uterine cavity.
Endometrial ablation and dissection of the submucosal myoma were performed within 70 min by monopolar resection.
The duration of the procedure was prolonged due to the reduced visibility caused by excessive bleeding and cervical leakage of distension medium, which impeded proper expansion of the uterine cavity.
The ventilation pressure increased slowly and continuously 60 min subsequent to the start of surgery.
The compliance of the lungs, as well as the achievable minute volume within the acceptable airway pressure limit of 2 kPa, decreased.
It was presumed that the level of anaesthesia was insufficient and was followed by the increased administration of propofol (10 mg/kg/h).
The additional inhalation of fenoterol did, however, not improve the situation.
As ventilation continued to be difficult, the laryngeal mask was replaced by a 7.0 cm (inside diameter) cuffed tube subsequent to the administration of 100 mg succinylcholine as a muscle relaxant.
Approximately 50 mL of a foamy, transparent liquid was aspirated from the trachea.
Testing with litmus paper indicated an alkaline pH and, therefore, not the aspiration of gastric content.
The amount of the pulmonary oedema increased and, despite high levels of peak airway pressures at this point approximately 3 kPa (= set peak pressure limit), adequate ventilation was not possible.
Blood gas and electrolyte analyses indicated acidosis, as well as a severe hyponatremia (pH 7.11; Na 74 mEq/L; partial pressure of CO2 49.9 mmHg; saturation of O2 97 % at FiO2 1.0).
Cardiopulmonary changes remained minimal.
40 mg of furosemide and 500 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were immediately administered at an infusion rate of 500 mL/h, with constant monitoring for electrolyte changes.
As the patient showed clinical signs of impaired haemostasis, the operation procedure was stopped.
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit with continuous administration of 3 % NaCl at a rate of 50 mL/h and electrolyte control.
Plasma sodium levels increased from 74 mEq/L to 103 mEq/L after one hour, and to 130 mEq/L after 7 h (Fig. ).
All together 800 mL of 3 % NaCl solution were administered within 7 h totalling at 24 g.
Subsequently, sodium replenishment was stopped and the patient was extubated without problems.
Immediate neurological assessment revealed no detectable deficits.
20 h after the onset of hyponatremia, the patient’s sodium levels returned to within the normal range.
Until then, the cumulative renal excretion was 8.5 L.
9 L of distension medium was used intraoperatively with a calculated uptake of 5 L.
The patient was relocated to the gynaecologic ward the following day and was released from the hospital on the third postoperative day without any detectable sequelae.",
    "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?",
    "LLM Answer": "78.1",
    "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault equation, I need the following parameters from the patient note:\\n\\n1.
Age: The patient is 45 years old\\n2.
Weight: 58 kg\\n3.

    "Ground Truth Answer": 78.121,
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female.
The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\r\nThe patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\r\nThe patient is 45 years old.
\r\nThe concentration of creatinine is 0.7 mg/dL.
\r\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\r\nThe patient's height is 156.0 cm, which is 156.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.56 m.
The patient's weight is 58.0 kg.
The patient's bmi is therefore 58.0 kg / (1.56 m * 1.56 m) = 23.833 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 23.8, indicating they are normal weight.\r\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.
Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 48.759 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 45) * 48.759 * 0.85) / (0.7 * 72) = 78.121 mL/min.

    "Patient Note": "A 41-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our hospital with liver damage, itchy skin, and pyrexia.
His medical history was unremarkable, but one year previously his gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels had risen to 271 IU/L (normal: < 30 IU/L).
Prior to this, the patient had consumed 540 mL of sake three times a week, and he had been reducing the amount of alcohol he consumed for about one year.
He did not smoke or take any recreational drugs.
He was single, was not homosexual, and he had not had sexual intercourse for over one year.\r\nThe patient had undergone treatment of his internal hemorrhoids as an outpatient at a nearby hospital that comprised an aluminum potassium sulfate and tannic acid (ALTA) injection.
He developed a fever of 38 °C, dark colored urine, and itchy skin on postoperative day (POD) 1, and he took loxoprofen sodium, as required.
He consulted another doctor on POD 7, because the symptoms had not improved, and his blood test results led to a diagnosis of liver dysfunction.
His liver dysfunction had not improved by POD 14, and he was admitted to our hospital on POD 15.\r\nThe patient was 167 cm tall and weighed 52.5 kg.
He presented with a blood pressure of 103/59 mmHg, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, a temperature of 36.6 °C, and 99% oxygen saturation in room air.
No specific physical findings were evident during the clinical examination on the day of hospitalization, but the patient had a rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and jaundice.
The subjective symptoms, comprising the fever, dark colored urine, and itchy skin, had disappeared by POD 10.\r\nThe laboratory test results showed that the patient’s complete blood count was almost normal with a white blood cell count of 6900 cells/μL, a hemoglobin concentration of 14.7 g/dL, a hematocrit level of 43.1%, and a platelet count of 3.98 × 105 cells/μL, but a higher percentage of eosinophils was present (6.8%) (normal: 1.0%-5.0%), which peaked at 13.9% on POD 20.
The patient’s serum liver enzyme and bilirubin levels were elevated at the time of admission.
The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was 432 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was 911 IU/L (normal: 10-40 IU/L), the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level was 473 IU/L (normal: 115-359 IU/L), and the total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (normal: 0.2-1.2 mg/dL).
Thus, compared with the ALP level, the AST and ALT levels showed greater magnitudes of elevation.
The patient’s other blood test results were within the normal ranges, as follows: serum albumin: 4.0 g/dL (normal: 3.8-5.2 g/dL); serum creatinine: 0.86 mg/dL (normal: 0.65-1.09 mg/dL); C-reactive protein: 0.1 mg/dL (normal: 0-0.3 mg/dL); prothrombin time: 100% (normal: 80%-120 %); thyroid-stimulating hormone: 0.5 μIU/mL (normal: 0.34-4.04 μIU/mL); triiodothyronine: 2.98 pg/dL (normal: 2.36-5.00 pg/dL); and thyroxin: 1.18 ng/dL (normal: 0.88-1.67 ng/dL).
The serological tests for autoantibodies generated weakly positive results (1:40) for anti-nuclear antibodies, and negative results for anti-smooth muscle and anti-mitochondrial antibodies.
Negative results were obtained from the tests for the hepatitis B virus surface antigen, the hepatitis C virus antibody, rapid plasma reagin, the anti-Epstein-Barr virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, and the anti-cytomegalovirus IgM antibody, and from the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test.
The IgG level was within the normal range at 1415 mg/dL (normal: 800-1600 mg/dL) and the IgM level was within the normal range at 100 mg/dL (normal: 60-250 mg/dL).
The IgE level was elevated at 1333 mg/dL (normal: < 250 mg/dL).
Chest radiography did not reveal any abnormalities.
No morphological changes were evident following abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and abdominal computed tomography (Figure ).\r\nWhen the patient was hospitalized, we considered viral, alcohol-induced, autoimmune, drug-induced, biliary tract, and thyroid function-based diseases as frequent causes of acute liver dysfunction for the differential diagnosis, and, based on the patient’s medical history, and the serological and imaging results, we considered that alcohol and DILI were highly likely causes of the patient’s acute liver dysfunction.
However, the patient had stopped drinking during the past year, so we thought that there was a high likelihood of DILI.
Therefore, we began conservative treatment with a small amount of extracellular fluid replacement.\r\nFigure presents the patient’s symptoms, laboratory test results, and treatment over the entire course.
The liver transaminase and bilirubin levels decreased rapidly after admission, and the maximum levels were as follows: ALT: 950 IU/L on POD 15; AST: 470 IU/L on POD 17; and total bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL on POD 17.
The ALP and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels showed consistent downward trends from POD 7.
The patient's symptoms disappeared on POD 10, and no new symptoms appeared after hospitalization.
We performed a liver biopsy on POD 25, and a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test (DLST) of the components of the ALTA injection and lidocaine on POD 28.
The patient was discharged on POD 29, and he was managed as an outpatient without any prescriptions.
At the time of the patient’s first outpatient appointment on POD 35, his liver transaminase and bilirubin levels had declined and were almost within the normal ranges.\r\nFigure presents hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)-stained sections of the liver biopsy performed on POD 25.
The H and E staining showed that the basic structure of the liver had been maintained without any hepatocyte dropout or disruption, and that the bile duct had not been disrupted.
At a higher magnification, the H and E staining showed that the parenchymal cells were partially dilated and that a mild inflammatory cell infiltration was present in the area of the central vein.
Neither eosinophil nor plasma cell infiltrations were detected within the liver tissue.
Bile plugs were found at multiple sites within the parenchyma and sinusoids.
Masson staining did not show the presence of liver tissue fibrosis.\r\nThe lymphocyte proliferation activity levels, which were determined from the DLST performed on POD 28, were 676 counts per minute (cpm) for the control and 871 cpm for the ALTA with lidocaine.
The stimulation index, which was calculated as the ALTA with lidocaine cpm divided by the control cpm, was 1.29 (normal in Japanese people: < 1.8).",

    "Patient Note": "A 71-year-old man, non-smoker (height: 155 cm; weight: 59 kg), was scheduled to receive video-assisted thoracoscopic extended thymectomy with the diagnosis of MG.
Two months previously, he developed symptoms of right ptosis and progressive swallowing difficulty.
Based on a positive response to edrophonium and increased titers of autoantibodies to acetylcholine receptor (19.3 nmol/L; normal < 0.2 nmol/L), he was diagnosed as having MG with severity belonging to Osserman's classification IIb (ie, generalized moderate weakness and/or bulbar dysfunction).
Thoracic computed tomography demonstrated glandular hyperplasia of the thymus (Fig. A).
The patient was started on prednisolone 20 mg daily and pyridostigmine 60 mg three times daily.
His past history included hypertension without evidence of previous myasthenic crisis or thromboembolic events (eg, history of lower limb swelling).
The results of electrocardiography, pulmonary function test [eg, vital capacity: 93%], echocardiography (eg, left ventricular ejection fraction: 85.1%), chest radiography (Fig. B), and laboratory studies (eg, coagulation test) were unremarkable.
On the other hand, impaired renal function [i.e., serum creatinine: 1.42 mg/dL; eGFR: 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2] was observed after admission.\r\nPreoperative physical examination of the patient showed clear consciousness without respiratory distress.
Vital signs included a blood pressure of 187/103 mm Hg, heart rate of 82 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 14 breaths/minute.
Under real-time neuromuscular monitoring with a train-of-four (TOF) monitor (TOF-watch SX, N.V.
Organon, Oss, Netherlands), anesthesia was induced with propofol (130 mg) and rocuronium (0.85 mg/kg).
Following successful tracheal intubation with a double-lumen tracheal tube (Broncho-Cath; Mallinckrodt, Athlone, Ireland), general anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane, rocuronium (total dosage: 40 mg), and a continuous infusion of remifentanil.
An 18-gauge peripheral intravenous line and an arterial line were introduced.
The surgical time was 4 hours 15 minutes with an estimated blood loss of 100 mL.
Upon completion of surgery, sugammadex 4 mg/kg was administered to reverse neuromuscular blockade, with a maximum TOF ratio of 0.93 following reversal.
Additionally, intravenous morphine 8 mg was given for postoperative analgesia.
After successful extubation in the operating room and resumption of spontaneous breathing, he was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for further care.\r\nDuring the immediate postoperative period, the patient was hemodynamically stable without respiratory distress.
Because of surgical pain with a numeric rating scale of 5 (scale of 0–10), intravenous morphine was titrated to a total dosage of 7 mg.
Forty-five minutes later, respiratory distress with drowsiness was noted.
Physical examination found pinpoint pupils with a TOF ratio of 0.9.
Blood gas analysis demonstrated severe hypercapnia (arterial carbon dioxide pressure: 117.7 mm Hg) and acidosis (pH: 6.996, lactate levels: 3.3 mmol/L).
On suspicion of morphine overdose, intravenous naloxone was administered twice (0.08 mg each time).
After 20 minutes, the patient regained consciousness and normal respiratory pattern.
Subsequent blood gas analysis demonstrated hyperlactatemia (lactate levels: 6.0 mmol/L) (Fig. ) despite improvement in arterial carbon dioxide pressure and arterial oxygen pressure after naloxone administration.
Taking into account the overall clinical improvement, he was transferred to ward with spontaneous breathing and stable hemodynamics after observation for 100 minutes following initial reversal of opioid overdose.\r\nHowever, one hour after being transferred to ward (ie, three hours after naloxone administration), he was found to exhibit consciousness loss, respiratory distress, and pinpoint pupils.
Intravenous naloxone 0.4 mg was given, followed by endotracheal intubation and transfer to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilatory support.
Brain computed tomography showed no intracranial lesion.
He regained consciousness two hours after naloxone administration in the intensive care unit without symptoms of opioid withdrawal (eg, pulmonary edema).
As weaning from mechanical ventilation was difficult on POD 3, a diagnosis of POMC was made.
Steroid therapy (prednisolone 40 mg twice daily) and pyridostigmine (60 mg 3 times a day) was initiated.
The patient was extubated smoothly on POD 6 and was discharged from hospital on POD 12.
The course of hyperlactatemia was shown in Figure .
In addition, his eGFR increased from 49.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline to 88.9 ml/min/1.73m2 on POD 5.
Pathological analysis of the specimen from thymectomy confirmed the diagnosis of type B2 thymoma according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification.\r\nThe patient was readmitted on POD 24 because of left thigh swelling.
Ultrasonographic examination showed evidence of DVT involving the left femoral and popliteal veins.
Anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (ie, subcutaneous Clexane 60 mg every 12 hours) was implemented immediately after hospitalization, and he was discharged without sequelae on POD 31.
During hospitalization, his eGFR was 86.5 mL/min/1.73m2.
There was no recurrence of myasthenic crisis or DVT up to 3 months of follow-ups.",
    "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?",
    "LLM Answer": "39.8",
    "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault equation, I need to gather the relevant parameters from the patient note.
The patient is a 71-year-old man with a height of 155 cm, weight of 59 kg, and serum creatinine of 1.42 mg/dL.
The Cockroft-Gault equation uses these variables to estimate creatinine clearance, which is a measure of kidney function.
Using the medcalc-crcl_cockcroft_gault calculator with these parameters, I obtained a creatinine clearance of 39.8 mL/min.
The calculator used the patient's actual weight since the patient is considered underweight based on BMI.",
    "Ground Truth Answer": 35.333,
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female.
The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\r\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\r\nThe patient is 71 years old.
\r\nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.42 mg/dL.
\r\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\r\nThe patient's height is 155.0 cm, which is 155.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.55 m.
The patient's weight is 59.0 kg.
The patient's bmi is therefore 59.0 kg / (1.55 m * 1.55 m) = 24.558 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.6, indicating they are normal weight.\r\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.
Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 52.355 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 71) * 52.355 * 1) / (1.42 * 72) = 35.333 mL/min.
Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 35.333 mL/min.",

    "Patient Note": "The patient was an 82-year-old woman who had a 3-year history of leg cramps and first had chest tightness for two years.
She had been treated for ischemic cardiomyopathy with triple vessel disease at another hospital, but had been hospitalized for heart failure 12 times in the last two years.
Echocardiography that was performed in the hospital reportedly revealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%.
The patient had a history of left thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer at the age of 67 years with no subsequent recurrence.
Comorbidities included angina pectoris, chronic heart failure, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, and gastric ulcer (gastrointestinal bleeding with antithrombotic drugs).
Her usual medications were tolvaptan 7.5 mg, azosemide 60 mg, furosemide 60 mg, rabeprazole 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, bisoprolol 0.625 mg, amiodarone 50 mg, levothyroxine sodium 50 μg, cremedin 6 g, and sodium ferrous citrate 100 mg.
Her ability to perform activities of daily living was good, and there was no history of alcohol drinking, smoking, or allergy.
She noticed shortness of breath and chest discomfort when she was about to go to the restroom in the morning, and was transported by ambulance to the emergency department of our hospital.\r\nPhysical findings on admission were: height, 153 cm; weight, 53 kg; body mass index, 22.6 kg/m2; body temperature, 36.9℃; blood pressure, 155/94 mmHg; heart rate, 83/min and regular; respiratory rate, 22/min; and SpO2, 98% (O2, 6 L).
The palpebral conjunctiva was not pale, and jugular venous distention was observed.
There were coarse crackles in both lung fields and no murmurs.
There was no peripheral coldness in the limbs and lower leg edema was observed.
A 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus rhythm at 71 beats/min, no ST elevation, and a negative T wave in leads V3-6 (Figure ).
The corrected QT interval (QTc) was prolonged by 556 ms.\r\nChest radiography showed a cardiothoracic ratio of 70%, indicating cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion, and bilateral pleural effusion (Figure ).\r\nEchocardiography showed akinesis mainly at the apex and diffuse hypokinesis at the base, showing systolic dysfunction with LVEF of 15%.
The blood tests revealed decreased renal function with a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 88 mg/dL, creatinine level of 3.26 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 11.1 mL/min/BSA.The serum albumin level was 3.3 g/dL and serum potassium level was 4.5 mmol/L.
Creatine kinase (CK) was slightly elevated at 191 U/L, but the creatine kinase-myocardial band (2.8 ng/mL) and troponin I (0.02 ng/mL) levels were not elevated.
The level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 802.7 pg/mL.
A diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure was made, and treatment with oxygen and diuretics (furosemide 20mg) was started.
The patient responded well and urine volumes in the initial three hours were 400 mL; however, 12 hours after admission, she experienced sudden onset chest pain and pain radiating to the neck.
Consciousness at the time of the attack was clear, systolic blood pressure was 120 mmHg, heart rate was 80/min with sinus rhythm, and SpO2 was 89% (O2 10 L).
The pain extended to the extremities.
The 12-lead ECG at the time of the attack was not significantly different from that at the time of admission (Figure ).
Chest radiography showed worsening pulmonary congestion (Figure ).
Echocardiography and blood sampling showed no marked change from that on admission, no increase in cardiac enzymes, and no findings strongly suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.
When respiratory management by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation was continued, symptoms improved after approximately one hour.
Although serum calcium and magnesium levels were not measured at the time of admission, additional examinations revealed hypocalcemia with a calcium level of 4.9 mg/dL and hypomagnesemia with a magnesium level of 1.7 mg/dL.
The phosphorus level was 6.3 mg/dL.
It was considered that the symptoms were due to a tetanic seizure.
The cause of hypocalcemia was thought to be chronic kidney disease (CKD) because parathyroid function, as reflected by intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), was preserved (122.7 pg/mL) despite prior operation on the thyroid gland.
Since the level of consciousness and symptoms did not deteriorate, calcium correction was started by oral administration while magnesium was corrected by drip infusion.
The patient rapidly responded to intravenous infusion of magnesium and oral administration of calcium and vitamin D preparations.
Serum calcium normalized on day 6 of hospitalization and the corrected calcium level was 9.1 mg/dL at the time of discharge.
The QTc on ECG decreased from 556 to 491 ms (Figure ).
The electrolyte abnormality improved without subsequent recurrence of tetany.
The LVEF by echocardiography improved from 15% to 27% at the time of discharge.
Although coronary angiography was not performed because of renal dysfunction, the LV contraction failure may have been affected by hypocalcemia.
Her heart failure was well controlled with tolvaptan 15 mg, azosemide 90 mg, furosemide 20 mg and and bisoprolol 0.625 mg (Figure ), and she left hospital on the 13th day of hospitalization.",
    "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?",
    "LLM Answer": "9.7",
    "LLM Explanation": "To calculate creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, I need the patient's age, weight, height, serum creatinine, and sex.\\n\\nFrom the patient note:\\n- Age: 82 years old\\n- Weight: 53 kg\\n- Height: 153 cm (converting to inches: 153 cm ÷ 2.54 = 60.24 inches)\\n- Serum creatinine: 3.26 mg/dL\\n- Sex: female\\n\\nI used the Cockcroft-Gault calculator with these values.
The calculation takes into account that this is an elderly female patient with significantly elevated serum creatinine, indicating poor kidney function.
The calculation used the ideal body weight (IBW) of 46.1 kg rather than the actual weight since the patient has a normal BMI.",
    "Ground Truth Answer": 9.671,
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female.
The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\r\nThe patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\r\nThe patient is 82 years old.
\r\nThe concentration of creatinine is 3.26 mg/dL.
\r\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\r\nThe patient's height is 153.0 cm, which is 153.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.53 m.
The patient's weight is 53.0 kg.
The patient's bmi is therefore 53.0 kg / (1.53 m * 1.53 m) = 22.641 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 22.6, indicating they are normal weight.\r\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.
Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 46.043 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 82) * 46.043 * 0.85) / (3.26 * 72) = 9.671 mL/min.
Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 9.671 mL/min.",

    "Patient Note": "A 47-year-old female (height, 160 cm; weight, 60 kg) with a giant liver due to polycystic liver disease (PLD) was scheduled to undergo ABO-incompatible living donor liver transplantation because of worsening malnutrition, disability in activities of daily living, and abdominal distention, which were converted to 16 points by the model for end-stage liver disease score.
In the past 3 years, coil embolization of the hepatic artery and percutaneous drainage of liver cysts had been performed.
After the liver cyst drainage, biliary peritonitis occurred and she was treated with antibiotics.\r\nPreoperative computed tomography revealed remarkable abdominal distension caused by an enlarged polycystic liver ().
Results of laboratory tests were as follows: hemoglobin (Hb), 10.1 g/dL; platelet (Plt) count, 27.4 × 104/μL; albumin, 2.2 g/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 31.3 mg/dL; creatinine, 0.90 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 0.31 mg/dL; alanine transaminase, 13 U/L; aspartate transaminase, 15 U/L; prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR), 1.18; activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 30.0 sec; fibrinogen, 573 mg/dL.
An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, and transthoracic echocardiography showed normal cardiac function.
Portal hypertension was not predicted.
The surgeons pointed out a risk of bleeding because of surgical difficulties due to PLD and strong adhesion induced by peritonitis.
Blood loss anticipated by the surgeon was 15000 ml.
The transfusion unit was preoperatively informed about the possibility of massive transfusion.
We ordered 5,600 mL of O type red blood cells (RBC), 4,800 mL of AB type fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 800 mL of AB type platelet concentrate (PC).\r\nAfter induction of general anesthesia, three 18-gauge peripheral catheters, a 12-gauge triple-lumen central venous catheter, and a pulmonary arterial catheter were placed.
Since total clamping of the inferior vena cava requiring veno-veno bypass might be necessary, two 4-Fr introducer sheaths were placed at the femoral vein and the intrajugular vein.
Soon after the start of surgery, massive bleeding of more than 4,000 mL/hr occurred ().
We started massive transfusion of FFP at a ratio of about 1 : 1 with RBC.
We also transfused 5% albumin and restricted the crystalloid solution.
Reinfusion of salvaged blood and use of veno-veno bypass with retrieved blood from the operative field were avoided because many cysts of the PLD ruptured during surgery and the blood in the operative field was contaminated by the cystic content.
We constantly ordered blood products and communicated with the transfusion unit.\r\nThe bleeding rate increased as the surgery progressed because bleeding occurred from the area where the tissue was detached from adhesion.
Body temperature rapidly decreased despite the use of a rapid infusion and fluid warming system (Level 1 Fast Flow Fluid Warmer, Smiths Medical ASD Inc., Rockland, MA, USA) through 4-Fr introducer sheaths.
Although catecholamine administration and massive transfusion from 5 venous lines including the introducer sheath were performed by many anesthesiologists, it was extremely difficult to maintain blood pressure and a critical situation with a risk of cardiac arrest continued due to hypotension.
In addition, even though administration of insulin and calcium was performed, electrolyte disturbances of K+ of 6.3 mEq/L and Ca2+ of 2.1 mg/dL (normal range: 4.6–5.3 mg/dL) with peaked T wave and prolongation of QTc interval (557 msec) occurred (Figures and ).
At that time, we visually noticed that the QT interval was shortened in response to bolus calcium administration, and we therefore displayed the QTc interval on a bedside monitor (CSM-1000 series Life Scope G, Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan) and used the change of real-time QTc interval as a supportive indicator for calcium correction (maximum rate: 120 mEq/hr) combined with blood gas analysis.
The hepatectomy was performed without veno-veno bypass 4.5 hours after the start of surgery and the bleeding rate at that time was 15,000 mL/hr ().
The excised polycystic liver weighed 10.0 kg.\r\nUntil portal reperfusion, we continued massive transfusion (approximately 12,000 mL/hr) including 300 mL of PC and sodium bicarbonate with additional fluid warming systems.
After portal reperfusion, the bleeding rate gradually decreased and the hemodynamic variables and electrolyte disturbance improved (Figures and ; ).
After anastomosis of the hepatic artery, 1 g of tranexamic acid was administered.
Except for PC, which was transported from transfusion centers in our region and/or neighboring regions, the supply of blood products was not interrupted and coagulation factors were maintained throughout the surgery by administration of FFP and 3 g of fibrinogen with at least 1.26 of PT-INR, 43.6 sec of APTT, and 116 mg/dL of fibrinogen ().
The abdomen was packed with gauzes and closed because complete hemostasis was difficult.
The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).
Soon after arrival at the ICU, she responded to command.
On postoperative day (POD) 2, second-look surgery was performed for removal of packed gauzes.
She was extubated on POD 3 without pulmonary edema or cardiac overload.\r\nThe duration of surgery was 16 hours and 53 minutes and the duration of general anesthesia was 22 hours and 27 minutes.
Throughout the surgery, anesthesia was maintained with 1.5% sevoflurane, 0.16–0.33 μg−1 ・kg−1 ・min−1 of remifentanil, and intermittent fentanyl administration (total of 1.5 mg).
Bispectral IndexTM (Aspect Medical Systems, Norwood, MA, USA) values were between 30 and 60.
Cardiac index was between 1.2 and 2.8 L−1 ・min−1 ・m−2.
A total of 742 mEq of calcium ion, 750 mL of 7% sodium bicarbonate, and 18 units of insulin were administered.
Postoperative analysis of the relationship between QTc interval and Ca2+ during surgery showed a strong negative correlation ().
Representative laboratory data are shown in .
Total infusion volume was 88,560 mL (crystalloid solution: 3,450 mL; 6% hydroxyethyl starch: 3,500 mL; 5% albumin: 10,490 mL; RBC: 34,160 mL; FFP: 34,600 mL; PC: 2,400 mL), and total output volume was 86,350 mL (estimated volume of blood loss including ascites and cystic fluid: 81,600 mL; urine output: 4,750 mL); therefore, intraoperative fluid balance was +2,210 mL.
Although she suffered from acute rejection and sepsis, she finally regained independent living by rehabilitation and was discharged on POD 156.",
    "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?",
    "LLM Answer": "63.9",
    "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault equation, I need the following information from the patient note:\\n1.
Age: 47 years old\\n2.
Weight: 60 kg\\n3.
Height: 160 cm (I converted this to inches: 160 cm ÷ 2.54 = 62.99 inches)\\n4.
Sex: Female\\n5.
Serum Creatinine (SCr): 0.90 mg/dL\\n\\nI used the Cockroft-Gault calculator with these values.
The formula calculates both ideal body weight (IBW) and adjusted body weight (ABW), then uses the appropriate weight based on the patient's BMI.
In this case, it used the IBW of 52.4 kg for the calculation because the patient has a normal BMI.
The formula also includes a factor to adjust for female sex.",
    "Ground Truth Answer": 63.901,
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female.
The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\r\nThe patient's gender is female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\r\nThe patient is 47 years old.
\r\nThe concentration of creatinine is 0.9 mg/dL.
\r\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\r\nThe patient's height is 160.0 cm, which is 160.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.6 m.
The patient's weight is 60.0 kg.
The patient's bmi is therefore 60.0 kg / (1.6 m * 1.6 m) = 23.437 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 23.4, indicating they are normal weight.\r\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.
Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 52.382 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 47) * 52.382 * 0.85) / (0.9 * 72) = 63.901 mL/min.
Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 63.901 mL/min.",

    "Patient Note": "A 66-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the authors’ hospital for fever and abdominal pain.
He had a past history of multiple renal cysts, chronic renal failure on chronic hemodialysis for 2 years, and multiple liver cysts due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).
He showed the relapse of infection of liver cysts and received longtime antibiotics therapies.\r\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.4 °C; heart rate, 101 beats per minutes (bpm); and respiratory rate, 20 bpm.
Laboratory examination revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7480 cells/mm3 with a high neutrophil count of 90.7%, and a C reactive protein of 18.08 mg/dl.
He was diagnosed as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) showed an abnormal high intensity at the multiple liver cysts, indicating that polycystic infection was strongly suspected.
Although antibiotic therapy with intravenous meropenem at a dose of 0.5 g/day was started, fever and inflammatory reactions were unable to improve.
Therefore, percutaneous echo-guided drainage was introduced for the most accumulated liver cyst.
Because of the improvements of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings, the drainage tube was removed at 19 days after drainage.
However, the low-grade fever and inflammatory reactions recurred, and the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy was difficult.
Because the most of the liver showed multilocular cystic changes, the control of infection was considered to be difficult by conservative treatments such as a local drainage or a partial liver resection, and the severe infection was expected to be repeated in the future.\r\nAs a fundamental treatment, a surgical approach was considered to be necessary, and a liver transplantation surgery was considered to be an indication for the disease.
Therefore, he was planned to undergo living-donor liver transplantation with a right lobe graft from his wife.
The graft was selected with considering a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.88%, which is larger than the minimal recommended ratio of 0.8%.\r\nBefore the liver transplantation, he was 168.0 cm tall and weighed 68 kg.
Physical examination revealed hepatomegaly extending below the level of the umbilicus.
Laboratory data showed anemia (Hb 10.4 g/dL), and the elevation of C-reactive protein (2.61 mg/dL).
Liver and renal profiles were as follows: total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL; albumin, 3.3 g/dL; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 17 U/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 10 U/L; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.3; creatinine, 5.09 mg/dL.
His Child-Pugh score was 7 (grade B), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was 22.
Arterial blood gas analysis showed that blood pH was 7.44, PaCO2 32.9 mmHg, PaO2, 82.1 mmHg in room air, and alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient (A-aDO2) was increased to 26.8 mmHg.
Chest X-ray revealed an elevation of right diaphragm.
Computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly with multiple liver cysts, multiple renal cysts, mild ascites, and no abnormal findings in the lung (Fig. ).
Respiratory function test showed the forced vital capacity (FVC) was mildly reduced down to 72% of predicted value, and the adjusted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLco) by Cotes’ method was moderately reduced down to 57.8% of predicted value.
Venous ultrasonography revealed lower extremity venous thrombosis, and the day before the operation, an inferior vena cava filter was inserted by a right internal-jugular-vein approach without any complications.
At 114 days after admission, a living related liver transplantation was performed.
After endotracheal intubation, two central venous catheters were inserted from left and right internal jugular veins before surgery without any complications.\r\nGeneral anesthesia was induced with propofol and remifentanil, and maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil.
The artificial ventilation was uneventful, and the airway pressure was kept below 30 cmH2O during the intraoperative period.\r\nThe abdominal cavity was reached through the upper abdominal reverse-T incision.
The liver was found to swell markedly and to push the right diaphragm upward.
Although the liver was firmly adhered to the right diaphragm, the adhesion was sharply dissected by electrocautery under appropriate traction.
After the extraction of the liver, the right diaphragm was found to swell markedly and occupy the abdominal cavity.
Although there was no significant change in the vital signs, the right pneumothorax was suspected, a thoracic drain was immediately inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and continuous drainage was initiated.
However, the right diaphragm distended by a massive air leak and prevented the operators from anastomosing the liver vessels and the bile duct.
Therefore, a small relaxing incision was made in the right diaphragm for depressurizing the right thoracic cavity and making an adequate operative field to anastomose.
Thoracoscopic observation was performed through the diaphragm incision.
There was no adhesion in the right thoracic cavity, and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the right lung was widely expanded like a giant cyst due to dissection from the lung parenchyma, and a marked air leak was recognized from a pin hole in the dissected pleura.
Since controlling the air leakage in the patient was considered difficult only by drainage, a leakage closure operation was decided to be performed after the completion of the liver transplantation.
Following the transplantation procedure, the thoracoscopic leakage closure operation was performed for the patient in the supine position.\r\nDuring operation, a thoracoscope was inserted through the right tenth intercostal space, and endoscopic surgical instruments were inserted through the small diaphragm incision (Fig. ).
The expanded visceral pleura was incised by electrocautery to drain air and pooled blood in the cyst, and bleeding sites in the lung parenchyma were identified and controlled by electric coagulation.
Because the lung parenchyma and the visceral pleura of the bottom of the lung was widely dissected and the base of the cyst was large, cystectomy was found to be difficult to be performed by a stapler or sutures.
For controlling the air leakage, absorbable fibrin sealant patches (TachoSil®, Baxtor Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, USA) were patched on the lung parenchyma under dissected visceral pleura, and fibrin glue (Beriplast P®, CSL Behring, Tokyo, Japan) was injected into the dissected space.
After no air pooling was confirmed under the visceral pleura with positive pressure ventilation, polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets (Neoveil®, Gunze, Kyoto) were applied, and fibrin glue was sprayed on the visceral pleura surface (Fig. ).
Finally, a 21Fr silicone thoracic tube was inserted through the right 10th intercostal space and placed on the apex of right thoracic cavity, and the diaphragm and abdominal incision was closed.
Although a postoperative minor air leakage was observed, chest X-ray showed the complete expansion of the right lung.
The patient was treated with water seal drainage.
After the air leakage disappeared, the drainage tube was removed at 27 days after surgery.
The course after liver transplantation was also smooth, and he was discharged at 67 days after surgery.
The cyst on the bottom of the right lung was confirmed to disappear on chest CT after discharge (Fig. ).",
    "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?",

\r\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\r\nThe patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m.
The patient's weight is 68.0 kg.
The patient's bmi is therefore 68.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 24.093 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 24.1, indicating they are normal weight.\r\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.
Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 64.127 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 66) * 64.127 * 1) / (5.09 * 72) = 12.949 mL/min.
Hence, the patient's creatinine clearance is 12.949 mL/min.",

    "Patient Note": "A 53-year-old man was referred to our hospital for evaluation and management of hypertension and hypokalemia.
He was diagnosed with hypertension at the age of 40 years, and his blood pressure was poorly controlled with a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine at 40 mg/d).
He also had a past medical history of vasospastic angina and was a nonsmoker and social drinker.
In addition, he had no family history of cardiovascular diseases.
On admission, the patient was 168 cm tall and weighed 59 kg.
He was afebrile, with a blood pressure of 161/96 mm Hg and a regular pulse of 61 beats per minute.
There was no evidence of lung rales, cardiac murmurs, or an abdominal bruit.
His neurological examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory tests revealed that his serum creatinine level was 1.1 mg/dL, urea nitrogen level was 19 mg/dL, and serum sodium level was 140 mEq/L.
He also exhibited hypokalemia with a serum potassium concentration of 2.9 mEq/L; however, he had no subjective symptoms, including muscle weakness.
Plasma renin activity (PRA), plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), and aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) were <0.1 ng/mL/h, 292 pg/mL, and >2920, respectively.
Other adrenal hormone levels were within normal limits.
A chest radiograph and transthoracic echocardiogram showed no significant findings.
An electrocardiogram suggested nonspecific ST-T wave changes with premature atrial contractions.\r\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism was suspected, and therefore, a captopril challenge test and a saline infusion test were performed.
All these investigations revealed positive test results (Table ), which confirmed a diagnosis of PA.
A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test to exclude the diagnosis of subclinical Cushing's syndrome was negative.
An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a left adrenal mass (13 mm) (Figure ).
In adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated AVS, although aldosterone hypersecretion was observed in the left adrenal gland, the lateralization of the disease was not determined due to incomplete cannulation of the right adrenal vein (Table ).
The criteria of successful cannulation were based on the current Expert Consensus Statement.\r\n131I-adosterol scintigraphy under dexamethasone suppression showed an equivalently increased uptake in both adrenal glands (Figure ).
Because we could not exclude the bilateral PA, including aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) with microadenoma in the right adrenal gland, we performed the medical therapy with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA).
Although we administrated multiple antihypertensive agents including an MRA (eplerenone at 100 mg/d), an angiotensin II receptor blocker (azilsartan at 40 mg/d), a dual action beta blocker/alpha-1 blocker (carvedilol at 20 mg/d), a calcium channel blocker with an increased dose (nifedipine at 80 mg/d), an alpha-1 blocker (doxazosin at 2 mg/d), and an alpha-2 agonist (guanabenz at 4 mg/d), a home reading of the patient's blood pressure was above 140/90 mm Hg.
Moreover, he needed a large quantity of potassium chloride to compensate for his hypokalemia.\r\nDespite intensive medical therapy, he underwent percutaneous coronary intervention due to stable angina.
Following this, we performed AVS again, but the right adrenal vein was not successfully cannulated (Table ).
We discussed further the indication for surgery and decided to remove the left adrenal gland.
After laparoscopic left adrenalectomy, his blood pressure and serum potassium remained normal after the withdrawal of eplerenone, doxazosin, guanabenz, and potassium chloride and a dose reduction of azilsartan (at 20 mg/d), carvedilol (at 10 mg/d), and nifedipine (at 10 mg/d).
The PRA and PAC were 0.8 ng/mL/h and 57.1 pg/mL, 3 months after the adrenalectomy, respectively.
Macroscopic findings of the resected specimen showed a yellowish colored nodule (13 mm in diameter) in the adrenal gland.
We confirmed a diagnosis of an adrenocortical adenoma based on a histopathologic examination (Figure ); we also confirmed that the tumor cells were rich in the cytoplasm and were eosinophilic without malignant cells.",
    "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?",
    "LLM Answer": "64.8",
    "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, I need the patient's age, weight, height, sex, and serum creatinine level.
From the patient note, I identified these values:\\n\\n- Age: 53 years old\\n- Weight: 59 kg\\n- Height: 168 cm\\n- Sex: Male\\n- Serum creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL\\n\\nI used the medcalc-crcl_cockcroft_gault calculator function with these parameters.
The function returned a creatinine clearance of 64.8 mL/min.
The calculator used the patient's actual weight for the calculation since the patient is considered underweight based on BMI.",
    "Ground Truth Answer": 64.811,
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female.
The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\r\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\r\nThe patient is 53 years old.
\r\nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.1 mg/dL.
\r\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\r\nThe patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m.
The patient's weight is 59.0 kg.
The patient's bmi is therefore 59.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 20.904 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 20.9, indicating they are normal weight.\r\nBecause the patient is normal, we take take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.
Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us an adjusted body weight of 59.0 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 53) * 59.0 * 1) / (1.1 * 72) = 64.811 mL/min.

    "Patient Note": "JP is currently a 58 year old man with multifocal urothelial tumors of the urinary bladder despite two courses of intravesical mitomycin C and one six week course of BCG.\r\nThe patient appears well but has a significant past medical history consisting of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, mild congestive heart failure, chronic renal disease, and peripheral neuropathy.
He stopped cigarette smoking at age 35 after 15 years of smoking 1.5 packs/day.
He has had a coronary artery stent placed.\r\nThe patient has a BMI of 38 kg/m2.
He weighs 106 kg and is 168 cm in height.
He is thus markedly overweight with a large abdominal girth.
His recent creatinine is 2.13, BUN 38.
This has been stable for 3 years.\r\nHe presented with gross hematuria in 8/15.
Imaging disclosed left hydronephrosis with a filling defect in the left renal pelvis.
Ureteroscopy and biopsy revealed a low grade urothelial tumor in the renal pelvis.
In April 2016 he underwent a robotic assisted left nephroureterectomy.
The pathology indicated high grade pT3 urothelial cancer in the renal pelvis with small HG Ta and CIS in the ureter.
There was Ta tumor at the distal margin.
Adjuvant chemotherapy was discussed but was not given because of his renal failure.
Subsequent serial imaging has been negative for any metastasis.\r\nBeginning in July 2016 he has developed multifocal low or high grade Ta urothelial cancer of the bladder.
After the resection of over 10 HG Ta tumors in 7/16 he received intravesical mitomycin for six weeks.
In 11/16 he had a TUR BT of multiple tumors from one to 5 cm, LG Ta.
Although BCG is not likely to be effective for LG Ta he was given intravesical BCG for six weeks.
The next TUR BT was 3/17 and once again there was mutifocal HG Ta tumors.
This was followed with weekly mitomycin again.\r\nThe most recent TUR BT was in 7/17 and the pathology was LG Ta.
The largest tumor was at the 1 o’clock position just inside the bladder neck and required a bugby electrode with the 70 degree lens to visualize and remove, as it was not visible with the 12 or 30 degree lens.
His most recent cystoscopy was 10/17 and not surprisingly he has developed multiple small and large tumors which all appear Ta.\r\nThe patient’s quality of life has not changed as a result of the multiple resections.
He has not had gross hematuria since the left nephrectomy.
He has not developed an invasive tumor of the bladder.\r\nAlternative considerations for therapy are welcome such as a PDL inhibitor or other experimental treatment.\r\nPhotos will be of the tumor and the use of the blue bugby electrode for the tumor at the 1 pm location at the bladder neck.",
    "Question": "What is the patient's Creatinine Clearance using the Cockroft-Gault Equation in terms of mL/min?",
    "LLM Answer": "43.2",
    "LLM Explanation": "To calculate the Creatinine Clearance using Cockroft-Gault Equation, I need the following information from the patient note:\\n1.
Age = 58 years\\n2.
Weight = 106 kg\\n3.

    "Ground Truth Answer": 43.244,
    "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault is given by CrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * (gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female.
The serum creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\r\nThe patient's gender is male, which means that the gender coefficient is 1.\r\nThe patient is 58 years old.
\r\nThe concentration of creatinine is 2.13 mg/dL.
\r\nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m.\r\nThe patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.68 m.
The patient's weight is 106.0 kg.
The patient's bmi is therefore 106.0 kg / (1.68 m * 1.68 m) = 37.557 kg/m^2.The patient's BMI is 37.6, indicating they are overweight/obese.\r\nBecause the patient is overweight/obese, we use the adjusted body weight formula to get the adjusted weight used for Cockroft-Gault Equation.
Shown below is the computation for IBW (ideal body weight).\r\nThe patient's gender is Male.\r\nThe patient's height is 168.0 cm, which is 168.0 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 66.142 in.
\r\nFor males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:\r\nIBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)\r\nPlugging in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (66.142 (in inches) - 60) = 64.127 kg.\r\nHence, the patient's IBW is 64.127 kg.Shown below is the computation for ABW (adjusted body weight).\r\nTo compute the ABW value, apply the following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)).
ABW = 64.127 kg + 0.4 * (106.0 kg  - 64.127 kg) = 80.876 kg.
The patient's adjusted body weight is 80.876 kg.\r\n\r\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\r\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight * gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72).\r\nPlugging the patient's values gives us ((140 - 58) * 80.876 * 1) / (2.13 * 72) = 43.244 mL/min.

    "Patient Note": "In April 2011, an 81-year-old woman with a history of photosensitivity and hypertension was admitted to our hospital due to bilateral edema of the legs and nephrotic proteinuria (7.0 g/day).
Her proteinuria was not detected before March 2011 by screening test by the family doctor.
At admission, her height was 153 cm, weight was 40 kg, and blood pressure was 138/70 mmHg with treatment of candesartan 8 mg/day.
Physical examination showed bilateral pitting edema of her legs and palpable superficial inguinal lymphadenopathies.\r\nLaboratory results were as follows: serum creatinine 1.27 mg/dL; sodium 138.8 mEq/L; potassium 4.5 mEq/L; hemoglobin 14.6 g/dL; white blood cells 12,300/μL; platelet count 42,000/μL; serum total proteins 7.4 g/dL; and albumin 2.1 g/dL; total cholesterol 224 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 119 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 60 mg/dL, triglyceride 96 mg/dL.
She had an antinuclear antibody (ANA) titer of 1:40, with a speckled pattern that was associated with the presence of anti-dsDNA antibody (28 IU/mL).
Tests were negative for anti-Sm, anti-RNP, anti-SS-B, anti-SS-A, and anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies.
Her CH50 level was low (14.3 U/mL).
Microscopic urinalysis showed 51–100 red blood cells and 3–5 white blood cells per hyper field.
Proteinuria was 9.3 g/day and selectivity index was 0.01.
Chest and abdominal CT revealed no abnormalities.
She was diagnosed with SLE based on thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, positive ANA with anti-dsDNA antibody, and history of photosensitivity.\r\nBefore renal biopsy, we decided to treat her by prednisolone (PSL) 40 mg/day to normalize platelet count.
Five days after the treatment, platelet count increased to 127,000/μL.
Renal biopsy was performed 7 days after the treatment.
The specimen for light microscopy contained 26 glomeruli; 8 exhibited global sclerosis, 2 revealed focal endocapillary hypercellularity superimposed on several foam cells (Fig. ).\r\nImmunofluorescence (IF) showed low-intensity diffuse global granular capillary staining of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q.
Analysis by electron microscopy (EM) revealed electron-dense glomerular basement membrane deposits and foot process effacement (Fig. ).\r\nThis patient would have been diagnosed as LN class III (A) + V or III (A) because of scanty subepithelial immune deposition; however, we observed focal segmental foam cells closely resembling the cellular variant of FSGS.
Based on experience with FSGS from July 2011, we added cyclosporine 100 mg/day on the initiated treatment with PSL.
Within 3 months, the patient’s proteinuria rapidly improved from 9.3 to 1.8 g/day, and her leg edema completely disappeared.
Her CH50 level gradually increased, and her anti-dsDNA antibody titer decreased below the normal limit (Fig. ).
In March 2012, we performed a kidney re-biopsy.
We observed focal segmental sclerotic lesions and endocapillary foam cells.
IF with IgG, C3, and C1q showed bright granular staining, and EM showed electron-dense deposits at the same site.
Diffuse foot process effacement was still present (Fig. ).",

    "Patient Note": "Case 1 was a 20-year-old man with MMA.
He was born via cesarean section because of placenta previa at gestational age of 37 weeks with birth weight of 2.7 kg.
Due to positive family history (his brother had MMA), he underwent metabolic investigation.
His metabolic evaluation revealed blood ammonia level of 400–500 mg/dL and elevated C3 carnitine level (48.8; reference range, < 4.1).
The methylmalonic acid level in urine was 1617 µg/mg Cr, and elevation in plasma glycine (415 µmol/L) and alanine (978 µmol/L) levels were noted.
Cobalamin (Cbl) incorporation study of 14C-propionate showed lack of response to Cbl (i.e.
mut0) and slightly low response to adocobalamin (AdoCbl).
Molecular investigations revealed a compound heterozygous c.1105C > T(p.R369C), p.G94Q mutation.
He was fed with special formula (Propiomex), regular infant formula, low-protein food, and L-carnitine supplement (100 mg/kg/d).
His developmental evaluation at 20 months of age showed a mild delay.
Prior to 5 years of age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were in the normal range (BUN 6.6–12.3 mg/dL /creatinine 0.7–0.8 mg/dL).
However, after 5.5 years of age, his renal function slowly deteriorated, showing a BUN level of 16.2–29.2 and creatinine level of 0.81–1.02.
He was hospitalized multiple times due to metabolic decompensations (acidosis, dehydration, and hyperammonemia) after trivial infections or skipping of the special formula.
At 6 years of age, his eye sight deteriorated progressively and he became legally blind due to optic atrophy by 10 years of age.
He received growth hormone treatment for metabolic induction to anabolism and improvement of his short stature.
At 15 years of age, he experienced vomiting and abdominal pain due to pancreatitis.
His metabolic status became unstable; he was hospitalized more than 7 times with pancreatitis (Table ).
At this time, he began to experience hand tremors due to his metabolic condition.
After recurrent pancreatitis at 19 years of age, he showed glucose intolerance.
By the age of 20 years, he developed DM, requiring insulin injection.
His most recent metabolic crisis was accompanied by severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.8), liver dysfunction (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 245 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 316 IU/L), hyperventilation, hemorrhagic gastritis, and left pleural effusion.
His pancreatic amylase and lipase levels were > 4000 U/L.
He was put on continuous renal replacement therapy for 3 days.
During the metabolic crisis, he experienced seizures and hand tremors, although the results of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal.
The abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed necrotizing pancreatitis and follow-up ultrasound after 1 month of pancreatitis showed a pancreatic pseudocyst.
His renal function progressively deteriorated, showing a BUN level of 40.1–60 mg/dL, Cr level of 2.04–2.81 mg/dL, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level of 43.7 mL/min/1.73 m2.
His metabolic parameters were as follows: pH, 7.30–7.31; HCO3 level, 11.2–20.6; methylmalonic acid level, 1768–3861 µg/mg Cr; glycine level, 625–1187 µmol/L (normal range: 158–302 µmol/L); alanine level, 508–825 µmol/L (normal range: 185–537 µmol/L).
His ferritin levels were 280–581.53 ng/mL (normal range: 50–200 ng/mL).
